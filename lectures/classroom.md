# The Virtual Classroom

The virtual classroom provides recorded and live lectures (video-streaming), and exercises with exciting topics on hydraulic engineering, water resources management, and ecohydraulics.

## Overview of Lectures
These pages provide complementary materials for the following lectures at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) (Germany):

- Integrated River Engineering and Sediment Management ([see on ILIAS](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_crs_1855964.html) or [read more on this website](../lectures/lectures.html#irme))

- Python Programming for Water Resources Engineering and Research ([see on ILIAS](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_crs_2101155.html) or [read more on this website](../lectures/lectures.html#pywrm) - only in the winter semester)


## Principles

```{admonition} Open Access
All fundamental contents are open access to promote the efficient use of data and models whenever, where ever and whoever you are.
```

The contents of this website explain open access software and with hints about how to collaborate with commercial codes (as used for example in engineering offices) in the sense of *good-to-know* information. Such software is explained in the classes upon students' needs and requests.

The classes target an international and interdisciplinary audience to foster work in versatile teams, because diversity is not only an enrichment, but also crucial for successful economic, socio-political, and scientific collaboration. Cultural diversity comes along with different solution strategies, which together lead to robust and elaborate approaches. This is why the classes supported on with this website target all cultures and ethnic groups with their manifold backgrounds, ages, and beliefs.
