## Welcome to Integrated River Engineering and Sediment Management

This course is divided into two parts:
1. River Engineering and Sediment Management, and
1. Integrated Flood Protection Measures.

The materials provided here support the exercises in the Integrated Flood Protection Measures part, which encompassed socio-economic aspects of flood damage, calculation of floodwater depths, technical flood protection measures and design and operation of retention basins among other things

Beyond the descriptions provided in documents along with the exercises, these descriptions are also made available here to facilitate online work that has gained a rapidly increasing importance due to recent events.

## Materials 

The provided online material guides through the numerical simulation exercise with the ETH Zurich's BASEMENT v.3. The guidance describes:

- Pre-process data: From point clouds to computational meshes
- Set up and run a numerical simulation with BASEMENT v.3
- Post-process simulation results: Visualize, understand and analyze the model output.
- Calibration & validation is here only mentioned as an integral part of numerical studies.
