## Principles 

{% include oa.html content="All fundamental contents are open access to promote the efficient use of data whenever, where ever and whoever you are." %}

For this reason, the contents explain use open-access software and the use of commercial codes (as used for example in engineering offices) can be considered complementary *good-to-know* information. Such software is explained in the classes upon students' needs and requests.

The classes target an international and interdisciplinary audience to foster work in versatile teams, because diversity is not only an enrichment, but also crucial for successful economic, socio-political, and scientific collaboration. Cultural diversity comes along with different solution strategies, which together lead to robust and elaborate approaches. This is why these classes target all cultures and ethnic groups with their manifold backgrounds, ages, and beliefs.
