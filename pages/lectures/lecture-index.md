## Overview
These pages provide complementary material for the following lectures tought at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany:

- [Integrated River Engineering and Sediment Management](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_crs_1855964.html) 

- Python Programming in Water Resources Engineering and Research (available in since winter semester 2020)

## The Classroom

The majority of the course takes place in front of a screen. Students can work on computers at the University of Stuttgart or use their own laptop. 

All codes provided in the lectures are based on *Python3* executed within Conda environments. The [install and setup](hypy_install.html#other) section provides more details and installation hints for external packages (preferred open-access).

## Principles 

{% include oa.html content="All fundamental contents are open access to promote the efficient use of data whenever, where ever and whoever you are." %}

For this reason, the contents explain use open-access software and the use of commercial codes (as used for example in engineering offices) can be considered complementary *good-to-know* information. Such software is explained in the classes upon students' needs and requests.

The classes target an international and interdisciplinary audience to foster work in versatile teams, because diversity is not only an enrichment, but also crucial for successful economic, socio-political, and scientific collaboration. Cultural diversity comes along with different solution strategies, which together lead to robust and elaborate approaches. This is why these classes target all cultures and ethnic groups with their manifold backgrounds, ages, and believes.
