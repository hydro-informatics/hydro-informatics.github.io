## Virtual Classroom

The majority of the courses take place in front of a screen. Students can work on computers at the University of Stuttgart or use their own laptop.

The virtual classroom is hosted at the GitHub classroom *Ecohydraulics-Python* ([`https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/65289754-ecohydraulics-python`](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/65289754-ecohydraulics-python)). 

{% include tip.html content="Students of the University of Stuttgart may login to GitHub using their institutional address ([click here to go to the TIK-GitHub login page](https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/login)). In addition, the usage of GitHub will be explained at the very beginning of the lecture as fundamental tool." %}


The codes provided in the lectures are mostly based on *Python3* executed for *conda* environments. The [install and setup](hypy_install.html) section provides more details and installation hints for external packages (preferred open-access).

## Assignments

Assignments (exercises) are provided as integral part of the [*Ecohydraulics-Python* classroom on GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/65289754-ecohydraulics-python). The assignments usually involve a started repository with 

* Assignment instructions,
* Basic code templates, and
* Data files (if needed).

The link to each assignment will be announced during the lectures. The assignment takes students to the *Ecohydraulics-Python* classroom and invites students to accept the assignment.

{% include note.html content="When you want to accept an invitation to an assignment for the very first time, you will need to authorize GitHub's classroom application." %}

Accepting the invitation to an assignment will create a local copy of the assignment repository.
