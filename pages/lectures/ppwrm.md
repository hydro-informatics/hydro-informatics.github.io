## Welcome 
This course introduces the version-control system git and the programming language Python 3. Students learn in this course to use programming methods for engineering tasks, data processing including basic statistical evaluations, and geospatial analyses. Practice-oriented exercises (assignments) guide through the programmatic solution to typical challenges in hydraulic engineering and research such as sediment transport assessments. The communication between efficient algorithms and typical spreadsheet (office) programs is presented and part of the exercises. The course also teaches data import, manipulation (calculation of statistics) and export. The last part of the course introduces geospatial programming methods and data analyses.

Interactive lectures familiarize students with version control via git, markdown language for documentation and Python programming. The course is organized by the [IWS/LWW department](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/lww/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) in the Winter semester. The course uses, however, open access material which is intended to serve as a reference guide and support for independent studies.

## Requirements
Previous programming experience is not necessary and the course also and explicitly addresses students who have not yet made use of programming tools.
