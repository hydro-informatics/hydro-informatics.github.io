## About 
This course introduces the version-control system git and the programming language Python 3. Students learn in this course to use programming methods for engineering tasks, data processing including basic statistical evaluations, and geospatial analyses. Practice-oriented exercises with small homeworks guide through the programmatic solution to typical challenges in water resources engineering and research such as ecohydraulic and sediment transport assessments. The communication between efficient algorithms and other data types (e.g., *JSON* or *xlsx* workbooks) is also presented and part of the exercises. The last part of the course introduces geospatial programming methods and data analyses.

Interactive lectures familiarize students with version control via git, markdown language for documentation and *Python* programming. The course is organized by the [IWS-LWW department](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/lww/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) in the Winter semester. In addition, the course builds on in-house and external open access materials, which serve as a reference guide and support for independent studies.

For this reason, register as soon as possible on [ILIAS](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_crs_2101155.html) and [C@MPUS](https://campus.uni-stuttgart.de/cusonline/pl/ui/$ctx/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=272592)." %}

## Requirements
The paramount requirement is the willingness to regularly invest time in the lectures, because this course is about more than just learning a programming language.
Previous programming experience is not necessary and the course also and explicitly addresses students who have not yet made use of programming tools.


## Schedule
Every Wednesday and Thursday morning live in *WebEx*, starting from November 4, 2020, through February 11, 2021.

{% include note.html content="The exact schedule is available on the University of Stuttgart's [ILIAS](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_crs_2101155.html) and [C@MPUS](https://campus.uni-stuttgart.de/cusonline/pl/ui/$ctx/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=272592&pSpracheNr=) pages." %}

## Learning objectives

Students acquire basic and advanced skills in Python programming, git version control, data handling and geospatial analyses. The dedicated learner deepens the ability to think logically and translate work processes into structured, object-oriented algorithms. Through the application of open-access software and git, students will be able to effectively support any team in the world and boost any project. The practice-oriented exercises transfer additional knowledge on how to leverage challenges in water resources management.
