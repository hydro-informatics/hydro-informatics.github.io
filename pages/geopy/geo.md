*Python* is connected with several libraries providing many open-source and commercial (proprietary) functions for the analyses of geospatial data. This section introduces both, open-source and (briefly) the commercial `arcpy` package. 

{% include tip.html content="<br>1. Start with reading the [Geospatial data](geospatial-data.html) page to understand the underpinnings of any geospatial analysis.<br>2. Use [QGIS](geo_software.html#qgis) to display geospatial data and to create maps in *PDF* or image formats (e.g., *tif*, *png*, *jpg*)." %}
