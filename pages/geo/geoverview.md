## QGIS
For the visualization of geodata (`.shp` and `.tif` files) a GIS software is required and the analyses described on these pages refer to the usage of [*QGIS* ](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) (*Please note: There is much more GIS software out there.*).

## ArcGIS Pro
The proprietary software *ArcGIS Pro* represents a powerful tool for any kind of geospatial analysis including web applications. *ArcGIS Pro* is maintained by [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/) and comes with an own [*Python conda Environments*](hypy_install.html).
With the focus on freely available software, the usage of *ArcGIS Pro* and its *Python* environment including the `arcpy` package is just mentioned on this website. 

## Others
There are many other tools for geospatial analyses, which all deserve much more than just being mentioned here. Alas, for practical reasons, this website focuses on the usage of *QGIS*. This is why there is just a absolutely-not-complete list of other GIS tools here:

* [SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses)](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html)
* [Mapline](https://mapline.com/)
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
* [uDig](http://udig.refractions.net/)
