***

A workbook editing software such as *Excel* or [*LibreOffice*][libreoffice] is required for modifications of user-defined databases (`.xlsx` files).

For the visualization of geodata (`.shp` and `.tif` files), GIS software is required, for example: [*QGIS* ](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) or [SAGA](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html) (*Please note: There are many more GIS softwares out there.*).

## Logfiles<a name="logs"></a>

***

Logfiles `logfile.log` are created in the module directories during every run task. These files contain time-stamped terminal messages of program activities, warnings and error messages. Thus, logfiles enable the user to review process duration and to trace back problems. The handling of potential errors and warning messages are listed in the [Troubleshooting Wiki](Troubleshooting)  with descriptions of problem sources (cause) and solutions (remedy).
