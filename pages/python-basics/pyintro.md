[*Python*](https://www.python.org) is a flexible and popular programming language that is easy to learn and can be used on nearby all [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) such as [*Linux*](https://www.linux.org/), *Windows*, or *MacOS*. A large and strong developer community provides many libraries for free, which can be installed and used as packages in *Python*. Besides engineering and scientific data analysis, *Python* also supports the development of web applications and services, desktop applications (graphical user interfaces - GUIs), scripting and [*Jupyter notebooks*](https://jupyter.org/). *Python* is used by many scientific institutions and software developers, but also more and more in other industries. This *Python* course is tailored engineers and scientists in the field of hydraulics and eco-morphodynamics.

This introduction on the following pages is based on [*Jupyter notebooks*](https://jupyter.org/) and inspired by tutorials provided on [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). 
<!-- Thus,  all code cells can be run inline rather than using a separate Python interactive window. -->
