This chapter provides exercises that align with the *Python* basics and geospatial chapters. The exercises are hosted in external repositories including sample data, graphs, and code frames (visit [https://github.com/Ecohydraulics](https://github.com/Ecohydraulics) and look for the *Exercise-* repositories).

The exercises lead through practical applications of *Python* programming in hydraulic engineering and ecohydraulics. The contents of the training include the dimensioning of reservoirs, calculation of flood return periods, simple hydraulic calculations as well as sediment transport estimates and habitat analyses. Each exercise starts with an explanation of the physical background of the applications.


Enjoy a successful and entertaining learning experience!
