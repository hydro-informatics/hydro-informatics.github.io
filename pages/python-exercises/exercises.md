This chapter provides exercises that align with the *Python* basics and geospatial chapters. Code templates including *README* files with instructions for the exercises are hosted in external repositories (visit [https://github.com/Ecohydraulics](https://github.com/Ecohydraulics) and look for the *Exercise-* repositories).

The exercises guide through practical applications of *Python* programming in water resources management, hydraulic engineering, and ecohydraulics. The contents of the training include the dimensioning of reservoirs, calculation of flood return periods, simple hydraulic calculations as well as sediment transport estimates and habitat analyses. Each exercise starts with an explanation of the physical background of the applications.

The following table summarizes the practice application and the coding aspects featured in the exercises on the following pages:

| Application goal                              | Code exercise                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Markdown & git repository creation            | get familiar with *git* and markdown documentation                    |
| Hydraulics (1D): Manning-Strickler solver     | loops, iterations, and functions                                      |
| Reservoir design (Sequent peak)               | data handling with *numpy*, communication with *csv* files            |
| Flood return periods calculation              | data and csv file handling with *pandas*                              |
| Sediment transport (1D): Meyer-Peter & MÃ¼ller | object orientation, communication with *xlsx* workbooks, and plotting |
| Interface to sediment transport (1D) code     | graphical user interface (GUI) creation                               |
| Geospatial ecohydraulics                      | object orientation and geospatial data manipulation                   |


Some exercises have ***HOMEWORK*** statements at the end. The described *HOMEWORK*s should be completed by the following lecture. Generally, every exercise not completed during the lecture should be completed in self-study until the next lecture.

Enjoy a successful and entertaining learning experience!
