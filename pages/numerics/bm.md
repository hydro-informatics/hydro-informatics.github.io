2-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation methods described on these pages use the freely available software *BASEMENT* 3.x, which is developed at the ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Visit their [web site](https://basement.ethz.ch/) to download the program and documentation. The here provided online material guides through a numerical simulation exercise with BASEMENT v3.0.2. The guidance describes:

- Pre-process data: From point clouds to computational meshes
- Set up and run a numerical simulation with BASEMENT v.3
- Post-process simulation results: Visualize, understand and analyze the model output.
- Calibration & validation is here only mentioned as an integral part of numerical studies.

To complete the exercise, the following additional software is required:

- [*QGIS* ](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) for pre- and post-processing
- [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) for the visualization of other 2- or 3-dimensional data and model output (post-processing)
