##	2D Model Calibration and Validation
A numerical model may provide good data, which are not usable meaning, unless a model is calibrated and validated. There are three possibilities to do so.
 
 1. Numerical calibration assess the stability of the simulation itself. The parameters affected are for example the [CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition) or other hydraulic parameters. A numerical calibration can be time consuming and requires expert knowledge to judge the validity of parameters. 
 1. Hydraulic calibration (and validation), which compares modeled water surface levels, flow velocities or bed shear stress with observation data. 
 1. Morphological calibration and validation compares simulated with observed terrain change rates (not applicable here because it was not applied in the model).
