Two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation methods described on these pages use the freely available software *open TELEMAC-MASCARET*, which was started as a commcercial code by the R&D group of Électricité de France (EDF). Since 2010, the TELEMAC-MASCARET Consortium took over the development (EDF R&D is still deeply involved) and freely provides the software and its source code under a [*GPLv3* license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

Visit their [website](http://www.opentelemac.org/) to learn more about TELEMAC-MASCARET. Since installing Telemac is not trivial, the *Software* chapter on this website dedicates an entire page to the [installation of TELEMAC-MASCARET](install-telemac.html).

{% include tip.html content="Before starting this tutorial, install [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) on a Virtual Machine (VM) as described on the [Virtual Machines (VMs)](vm.html) page in the *Software* chapter. Then, procede with the installation of [TELEMAC-MASCARET](install-telemac.html) on Debian Linux. Account for approximately 2 hours to get ready with TELEMAC-MASCARET." %}


The here provided online material guides through a numerical simulation exercise with TELEMAC-MASCARET v8p1r0. The guidance describes:

**THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION - EXPECTED RELEASE: SPRING 2021.**

<!--
- Pre-process data: From point clouds to computational meshes
- Set up and run a numerical simulation with TELEMAC-MASCARET
- Post-process simulation results: Visualize, understand and analyze the model output.

To complete the exercise, the following additional software is required:

- [*QGIS* ](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) for pre- and post-processing
- [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) for the visualization of other 2- or 3-dimensional data and model output (post-processing)
