## Course under construction. Expected release of this tutorial: Fall 2021.

Thank you for your patience.

{% include requirements.html content="This tutorial refers to *TELEMAC* v8p1 (parallel with *Open MPI*) installed on Debian Linux. For the best learning experience follow the installation guides for [Debian Linux on a Virtual Machine (VM)](#vm.html) and [*TELEMAC*](install-telemac.html)." %}

This tutorial uses descriptions provided in the [telemac3d_user_v8p1](http://ot-svn-public:telemac1*@svn.opentelemac.org/svn/opentelemac/tags/v8p1r2/documentation/telemac2d/user/telemac3d_user_v8p1.pdf) manual.

## Three-dimensional (3D) modelling with SALOME-HYDRO and TELEMAC

This tutorial guides through the pre-processing and modelling of three-dimensional flow phenomena with *Telemac3d* implemented in *SALOME-HYDRO*.

To get started, make sure to have *SALOME-HYDRO* installed ([see instructions](install-telemac.html#salome-hydro)).
