# Python Exercises

This chapter provides exercises that align with the *Python* basics and geospatial chapters. Code templates including *README* files with instructions for the exercises are hosted in external repositories (visit [https://github.com/Ecohydraulics](https://github.com/Ecohydraulics) and look for the *Exercise-* repositories).

The contents of the training include the dimensioning of reservoirs, calculation of flood return periods, simple hydraulic calculations as well as sediment transport estimates and habitat analyses. Each exercise starts with an explanation of the physical background of the applications.

The following table summarizes the practice application and the coding aspects featured in the exercises on the following pages:
