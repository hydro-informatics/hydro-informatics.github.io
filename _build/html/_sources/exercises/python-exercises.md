# Python Exercises

This section provides exercises that align with the *Python* basics presented in this ebook. Code templates including *README* markdown files with instructions for the exercises are hosted in external repositories (visit [https://github.com/Ecohydraulics](https://github.com/Ecohydraulics) and look for the *Exercise-* repositories).

The contents of the training include the design of reservoirs, calculation of flood return periods, simple hydraulic calculations, and sediment transport estimates. Every exercise starts with an explanation of the physical background of the applications.

The following table summarizes the practice application and the coding aspects featured in the exercises on the following pages:

| Application                               | Training goal                 |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1d Hydraulics (Manning-Strickler solver)  | loops, iterations, and functions |
| Reservoir design (Sequent peak)           | data handling with {ref}`numpy` , communication with *csv* files            |
| Flood return periods calculation          | data and csv file handling with {ref}`pandas`                              |
| Cross-section averaged sediment transport | {ref}`ooc`, {ref}`sec-xlsx`, and plotting |
| Create a Graphical User Interface (GUI)   | familiarize with {ref}`chpt-gui`   |
