# Geospatial Python

*Python* is connected with several libraries providing many open-source and commercial (proprietary) functions for the analyses of geospatial data. This section introduces both, open-source and (briefly) the commercial `arcpy` package. The goal of this section is to provide an understanding of how geospatial data can be used and manipulated with *Python* code. The file manipulation involves logical and algebraic operations, and conversion from and to other geospatial file formats.

```{admonition} Requirements
Make sure you understand the basics of *Python*, especially {ref}`var`, {ref}`sec-pyerror`, {ref}`chpt-functions`, and working with external {ref}`sec-pypckg`.
```

```{admonition} Maximize learning success
Use the {{ ft_url }} package to facilitate working with the tutorials provided with this eBook.

Understand {ref}`geospatial-data, which are the underpinnings of any geospatial analysis.

Use {ref}`qgis-install` to display geospatial data and to create maps in *PDF* or image formats (e.g., *tif*, *png*, *jpg*).
```

The descriptions of open source packages for geospatial data handling build on explanations from [Michael Diener's *Python Geospatial Analysis Cookbook*](https://github.com/mdiener21/python-geospatial-analysis-cookbook) (open access under MIT license). Therefore, if you want to learn more details about any here information provided, take a look at this comprehensive e-book.

Another excellent source of inspiration with many open-sourced examples is [*pcjericks* GitHub repository *py-gdalogr-cookbook*](https://pcjericks.github.io/py-gdalogr-cookbook/).
