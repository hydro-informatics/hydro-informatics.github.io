	abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical approach to the problem of designing the opening in a slit-check dam. The approach is based on the conservation of the mass of water and sediments and on the energy balance under steady conditions. It leads to a relationship among opening width, sediment characteristics, mountain river geometry, and water and sediment discharge. The final relationship can be simplified to make it suitable for practical applications. Also, the problem of unsteadiness of both water and sediment is considered, as well as the possibility of treating the unsteady flow as a sequence of steady states. The results of the theory were checked in a laboratory investigation using a scale model. Different opening widths were tested under conditions of steady and unsteady supplies of water and sediment. The mean grain size of the sediment, as well as the rates of sediment and water discharge, were changed in the experiments. The results of the experiments confirm the theory quite well.},

	abstract = {Spatial Monte Carlo Analysis (SMCA) is a newly developed Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique based on Spatial Compromise Programming (SCP) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique. In contrast to other conventional MCDM techniques, SMCA has the ability to address uneven spatial distribution of criteria values in the evaluation and ranking of alternatives under various uncertainties. Using this technique, a new flood management tool has been developed within the framework of widely used GIS software ArcGIS. This tool has a user friendly interface which allows construction of user defined criteria, running of SCP computations under uncertain impacting factors and visualization of results. This tool has also the ability to interact with and use of classified Remote Sensing (RS) image layers, and other GIS feature layers like census block boundaries for flood damage calculation and loss of life estimation. The 100-year flood management strategy for Oconee River near the City of Milledgeville, Georgia, USA is chosen as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the software. The test result indicates that this new SMCA tool provides a very versatile environment for spatial comparison of various flood mitigation alternatives by taking into account various uncertainties, which will greatly enhance the quality of the decision making process. This tool can also be easily modified and implemented for solving a large variety of problems related to natural resources planning and management.},

Modelers lack objective guidance of how to select the most appropriate one for a specific application. Such guidance can be provided by Bayesian model selection (BMS). Its applicability is however limited by high computational costs. To transfer it to computationally expensive river modeling tasks, we propose to combine BMS with model reduction based on arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion. To account for approximation errors in the reduced models, we introduce a novel correction factor that yields a reliable model ranking even under strong computational time constraints. We demonstrate our proposed approach on a case study for a 10-km stretch of the lower Rhine river. The correction factor may shield us from misleading model ranking results. In our case, the correction factor was shown to increase the confidence in model selection.},

Methods that identify areas prone to piping erosion at the regional scale are limited. The main objective of this research is to develop a novel modeling approach by using three machine learning algorithms�mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), and support vector machine (SVM) in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to map susceptibility to piping erosion in the loess-covered hilly region of Golestan Province, Northeast Iran. In this research, we have used 22 geo-environmental indices/factors and 345 identified pipes as predictors and dependent variables. The piping susceptibility maps were assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Validation of the results showed that the AUC for the three mentioned algorithms varied from 90.32\% to 92.45\%. We concluded that the proposed approach could efficiently produce a piping susceptibility map.},

As a result, it is ripe for reenvisioning in the light of the emergence of meter-scale, spatially explicit data and algorithmic geospatial analysis. This study developed and evaluated a new spatially explicit method for analyzing discharge-dependent hydraulics coined �hydraulic topography� that not only increases accuracy but also eliminates several sample- and assumption-based inconsistencies. Using data and hydrodynamic simulations from the regulated, gravel�cobble-bed lower Yuba River in California, power functions were fitted to discharge-dependent average width, depth, and depth-weighted velocity for three spatial scales and then their corresponding exponents and coefficients were compared across scales and against ones computed using traditional approaches. Average hydraulic values from cross sections at the segment scale spanned up to 1.5 orders of magnitude for a given discharge. Transect-determined exponents for reach-scale depth and velocity relations were consistently over- and underestimated, respectively, relative to the hydraulic topography benchmark. Overall, 73\% of cross-sectional power regression parameters assessed fell between 10 and 50 absolute percent error with respect to the spatially explicit hydraulic topography baseline. Although traditional transect-based sampling may be viable for certain uses, percent errors of this magnitude could compromise engineering applications in river management and training works.},

It discusses the basic knowledge and terminology of hydraulic modelling. The chapter focuses on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling and its application in ecohydraulics. It describes the fundamental equations of CFD. The methods for predicting flow properties are divided into four categories: three-dimensional (3D) hydraulic models, two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models, one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models and non-numerical hydraulic modelling. The chapter introduces the fundamental topics and concepts of numerical modeling. It describes the features of and differences among hydraulic model approaches and the major elements needed to set up numerical models. The chapter presents four case studies where the underlying hydrodynamic processes drive certain ecological functions, such as the availability of habitats for certain fish or types of vegetation.},

We relate the bed level changes and the deposited sediment in the side channels to the results of hydrodynamic computations. Two of the three side channels filled mainly with suspended bed-material load. In one of these channels, the bed level increased enough that vegetation has grown and fine suspended load has settled. In the third side channel, the bed shear stresses are much smaller and, in addition to the suspended bed-material load, fine sediment settles. Based on the side channel system at Gameren, we identify two types of side channels: one type fills predominantly with suspended bed-material load from the main channel and a second type fills predominantly with fine suspended load. This gives an indication of the main mechanisms that lead to the aggradation in artificial side channel systems.},

	abstract = {Water impoundment by dams strongly affects the river natural flow regime, its attributes and the related ecosystem biodiversity. Fostering the sustainability of water uses e.g., hydropower systems thus implies searching for innovative operational policies able to generate Dynamic Environmental Flows (DEF) that mimic natural flow variability. The objective of this study is to propose a Direct Policy Search (DPS) framework based on defining dynamic flow release rules to improve the global efficiency of storage systems. The water allocation policies proposed for dammed systems are an extension of previously developed flow redistribution rules for small hydropower plants by Razurel et�al. (2016).The mathematical form of the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution applied to lake equations for the stored water in the dam is used to formulate non-proportional redistribution rules that partition the flow for energy production and environmental use. While energy production is computed from technical data, riverine ecological benefits associated with DEF are computed by integrating the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) for fishes with Richter's hydrological indicators. Then, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied to build ecological versus economic efficiency plot and locate its (Pareto) frontier. This study benchmarks two MOEAs (NSGA II and Borg MOEA) and compares their efficiency in terms of the quality of Pareto's frontier and computational cost. A detailed analysis of dam characteristics is performed to examine their impact on the global system efficiency and choice of the best redistribution rule. Finally, it is found that non-proportional flow releases can statistically improve the global efficiency, specifically the ecological one, of the hydropower system when compared to constant minimal flows.},

While together these two fields have made significant scientific and social contributions to creating synthetic landscapes, it is presently infeasible to build artificial digital rivers that represent the diversity found on Earth. To understand and summarize the state of the science of rendering artificial river topography, we reviewed {\textgreater}225 scientific articles and produced a road map for artificial synthesis of digital river topography. We broadly classify methods of digital river synthesis by whether they are driven by expert-based decisions or are strategic in the use of rules for objective rendering, with some rules being physics-based theories of river morphogenesis. Expert approaches include map, brush, geometric and interactive design. Strategic approaches include deterministic equilibrium models, morphodynamic models, and stochastic approaches. For each approach we discuss the conceptual basis for each method and how they can be applied. Readers can then identify what methods can create different types of digital riverscapes. We close by discussing how cross pollination can serve geomorphology and computer science, the role of digital rivers in furthering geoscience progress, and future directions in digital river synthesis.},

	abstract = {There is a long research history addressing olfactory imprinting, natal homing, and non-natal straying by anadromous salmon and trout (Salmonidae). In undisturbed populations, adult straying is a fundamental component of metapopulation biology, facilitating genetic resilience, demographic stability, recolonization, and range expansion into unexploited habitats. Unfortunately, salmonid hatcheries and other human actions worldwide have affected straying in ways that can negatively affect wild populations through competitive interactions, reduced productivity and resiliency, hybridization and domestication effects, and outbreeding depression. Reduced adult straying is therefore an objective for many managed populations. Currently, there is considerable uncertainty about the range of `natural' stray rates and about which mechanisms precipitate straying in either wild or human-influenced fish. Research in several disciplines indicates that adult straying is affected by endocrine physiology and neurological processes in juveniles, incomplete or interrupted imprinting during rearing and emigration, and by complex interactions among adult maturation processes, reproductive behaviors, olfactory memory, environmental conditions during migration, and senescence physiology. Reported salmonid stray rates indicate that the behavior varies among species, among life-history types, and among populations within species. Most strays enter sites near natal areas, but long-distance straying also occurs, especially in hatchery populations that were outplanted or transported as juveniles. A majority of past studies has estimated straying as demographic losses from donor populations, but some have estimated straying into recipient populations. Most recipient-based estimates have substantiated concerns that wild populations are vulnerable to swamping by abundant hatchery and farm-raised strays.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have revealed the close coupling of components of annual streamflow hydrographs and the germination and establishment ofPopulus species. Key hydrograph components include the timing and magnitude of flood peaks, the rate of decline of the recession limb, and the magnitude of base flows. In this paper, we retrospectively examine establishment of four woody riparian species along the Bill Williams River, Arizona, USA, in the context of annual patterns of streamflow for the years 1993–1995. The four species examined were the nativePopulus fremontii, Salix gooddingii, andBaccharis salicifolia and the exoticTamarix ramosissima. We modeled locations suitable for germination of each species along eight study transects by combining historic discharge data, calculated stage-discharge relationships, and seed-dispersal timing observations. This germination model was, a highly significant predictor of seedling establishment. Where germination was predicted to occur, we compared values of several environmental variables in quadrats where we observed successful establishment with quadrats where establishment was unsuccessful. The basal area of mature woody vegetation, the maximum annual, depth to ground water, and the maximum rate of water-table decline were the variables that best discriminated between quadrats with and without seedlings. The results of this study suggest that the basic components of models that relate establishment ofPopulus spp. to annual patterns of streamflow may also be applicable to other woody riparian species. Reach-to-reach variation in stage-discharge relationships can influence model parameters, however, and should be considered if results such as ours are to be used in efforts to prescribe reservoir releases to promote establishment of native riparian vegetation.},

	abstract = {Ground-water and surface flow depletions are altering riparian ecosystems throughout the southwestern United States, and have contributed to the decline of forests of the pioneer trees Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) and Salix gooddingii (Goodding willow). On some rivers, these forests have been replaced by shrublands of Tamarix ramosissima (tamarisk), a drought-tolerant species from Eurasia. The physiological response of these three riparian plant species to decreases in water availability is well studied, but little attention has been given to shifts in community and population structure in response to declines in surface flow and ground-water levels. Based on study of 17 sites spanning a hydrologic gradient, this research identified hydrologic thresholds above which P. fremontii�S. gooddingii maintain tall dense stands with diverse age classes, and above which they are more abundant than T. ramosissima stands along the San Pedro River in Arizona. Surface flow permanence was the hydrologic variable that explained most of the variance in species abundance and relative importance, with inter-annual ground-water fluctuation and depth to ground water also contributing. P. fremontii and S. gooddingii were dominant over T. ramosissima at sites where surface flow was present more than 76\% of the time, inter-annual ground-water fluctuation was less than 0.5 m, and average maximum depth to ground water was less than 2.6 m, during a two-year period of data collection. Because T. ramosissima is a shrub species with smaller leaves and lower canopy heights than P. fremontii and S. gooddingii, these shifts in species composition corresponded to decreases in maximum canopy height and upper stratum (above 8 m) vegetation volume as site water availability declined. As well, sites with deeper water tables and more intermittent flows had greater areal coverage of shrublands and less of woodlands. The altered vegetation structure along dewatered rivers may lower wildlife habitat quality. This study provides river managers with quantitative hydrologic guidelines for conserving tall dense P. fremontii�S. gooddingii stands and emphasizes the importance of maintaining long-term hydrologic conditions that are favorable to these species. The study also has implications for riparian restoration and invasive species management by suggesting that desired outcomes may be achieved through restoration of physical processes.},

Using values from literature and excavations, this study examined rooting patterns for 125 riparian species of southwestern USA and asked if maximum root depth varies with 1) moisture affinity, 2) growth habit, 3) flowering season, and 4) exotic vs. native status. Root depth varied with all factors analyzed. Hydroriparian species had shallower roots than mesoriparian and xeroriparian species. Annuals had shallower roots than perennials, and shrubs had deeper roots than trees. Hydroriparian perennials and cool-season annuals had the shallowest roots; xeroriparian shrubs had the deepest. Plants varied widely in root depth as well as in root length (near surface laterals) and root:shoot ratios. This wide range is typical of ecosystems that have many water sources, with each rooting pattern being adaptive in a different hydrogeomorphic setting. Exotic species showed trait divergence as evidenced by greater rooting depths. There were many data gaps, with several species having no rooting data. There is a need for site-based studies of rooting patterns in dryland riparian zones to more accurately document hydrogeomorphic niches and predict changes in plant distributions.},

	abstract = {In recent years, dam management guidelines need to estimate the effects of downstream flow on environment. However, high-flow alters physical conditions such as water depth, flow velocity and water temperature in the downstream side of the river. These changes will lead to alteration in fish habitat of the river. In this paper, an eco-hydraulic model was used to determine the levels of fish habitat in the Colorado River downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam. This model has been proposed by combining hydrodynamic and heat transfer model with a habitat suitability index model based on fish preference curves. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) were chosen as target species because they represent both native and non-native fish in the study area. Flow velocity, water depth and water temperature were selected as the suitability indicators. The hydrological data from three high-flow experiments were analyzed to determine the effects of high-flow on the Colorado River ecosystem. Numerical model simulations were undertaken as follows: firstly, based on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer equation, three hydraulic factors including water depth, velocity and temperature distribution were simulated and the associated suitability for each was obtained based on the fish preference curves. Later, the habitat suitability equation was developed to simulate the target species� habitat situation in high flow effects. Finally, the WUA (weighted usable area) and OSI (overall suitability index) of the spawning fish species were quantitatively calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the high flow. The results show that the effects of three HFE are more severe in spawning flannelmouth sucker than in spawning rainbow trout. It is worth noting that the one day HFE was beneficial to spawning rainbow trout and harmful to spawning flannelmouth sucker but in the HFE of more than 8 days, both the spawning habitats were completely destroyed.},

	abstract = {River bank stabilization is a common practise and can be observed on most rivers around the world, often using hard-engineering riprap. Increasingly, bioengineered approaches using vegetation-based constructive materials is promoted to alleviate some of the negative ecological stresses of bank stabilization. Because these stabilization projects use a variety of techniques to create a site-specific design, they can have unexpected morphological implications and variable ecological benefits which can be anticipated using numerical modelling. Bioengineered bank stabilization creates roughness elements on both micro and macro scales, where only macro-roughness can be captured by bathymetric adjustments. The definition of micro- and macro-roughness depends on the spatial resolution of the model domain, and may be considered analogous to skin and form friction when characterizing natural alluvial bed environments. The objectives of this research are to assess the hydrodynamic impact of the added micro- and macro-roughness associated with a bioengineering pilot project planned in Quebec, Canada and to use this case study to propose new techniques for integrating increased roughness due to bank stabilization into numerical models. The roughness of the stabilization project is assessed by adjusting bathymetry to simulate macro-roughness features, and roughness coefficients to simulate micro-roughness features. Results show a significant dampening interaction term that reduced the cumulative effect on resistance to flow when both roughness types were applied.},

	abstract = {Quantitative models of landform development can help us to understand the evolution of mountains and regional topography, and the effects of tectonic motions and climate on landscape, including its fractal geometry. This paper presents a general and powerful three-dimensional model of fluvial erosion and deposition at hill- to mountain-range scale. The model works by accumulating the effects of randomly seeded storms or floods (precipitons) that cause diffusional smoothing then move downslope on digital topography grids, that erode portions of elevation differences, that transport a slope-limited amount of eroded material, and that deposit alluvium when their sediment-carrying capacity is exceeded. The iteration of these simple and almost linear rules produce very complicated simulated landscapes, demonstrating that complex landscapes do not require complex laws. Each process implemented in the model is affected differently by changes in horizontal scale. Erosion, a scale-free process, roughens topography at all wavelengths. This roughening is balanced by diffusive processes (scaling as 1L2) at short wavelengths and deposition (scaling (scaling as 1L2) at long wavelenghts. Such a mixture of scale-free and scale-dependent processes can produce multifractal behavior in the models. The fractal dimension of the model topography is much more sensitive to climatic variables than to tectonic uplift. Landscape evolution may be fractal, but it does not seem to be chaotic. Analysis of topography of areas in southern Arizona using variograms shows approximately fractal behavior, with mean fractal dimension around 2.2�2.3. Departures from an exact fractal relatioship imply that the topography is in detail multifractal. The fractal dimension at short wavelengths is less than that at long wavelengths. This variation could either be caused by the relative strengths of diffusive and erosional processes shaping the topography, or a result of changes in climatic or tectonic conditions still preserved in the landscape.},

	abstract = {Interactions between fluvial processes and floodplain ecosystems occur upon a floodplain surface that is often physically complex. Spatial patterns in floodplain topography have only recently been quantified over multiple scales, and discrepancies exist in how floodplain surfaces are perceived to be spatially organised. We measured spatial patterns in floodplain topography for pool 9 of the Upper Mississippi River, USA, using moving window analyses of eight surface metrics applied to a 1�1m2 DEM over multiple scales. The metrics used were Range, SD, Skewness, Kurtosis, CV, SDCURV, Rugosity, and Vol:Area, and window sizes ranged from 10 to 1000m in radius. Surface metric values were highly variable across the floodplain and revealed a high degree of spatial organisation in floodplain topography. Moran's I correlograms fit to the landscape of each metric at each window size revealed that patchiness existed at nearly all window sizes, but the strength and scale of patchiness changed within window size, suggesting that multiple scales of patchiness and patch structure exist in the topography of this floodplain. Scale thresholds in the spatial patterns were observed, particularly between the 50 and 100m window sizes for all surface metrics and between the 500 and 750m window sizes for most metrics. These threshold scales are 15�20\% and 150\% of the main channel width (1�2\% and 10�15\% of the floodplain width), respectively. These thresholds may be related to structuring processes operating across distinct scale ranges. By coupling surface metrics, multi-scale analyses, and correlograms, quantifying floodplain topographic complexity is possible in ways that should assist in clarifying how floodplain ecosystems are structured.},

Improving theoretical underpinnings coupled with increasing computational capacity has led to the development of several open source codes written in low-level languages. However, adapting these codes to new functionality or introducing greater flexibility often requires significant recoding. Here we present a multi-process, scalable, numerical model of geomorphological evolution, built with a modular structure and geared toward seamless extensibility. We implement recent algorithmic advances that reduce the computational cost of flow routing ��a problem that typically scales quadratically with the number of unknowns ��to linear in time while allowing for parallel implementations of geomorphic transport processes. Our scalability tests demonstrate that such parallelizations can achieve an order of magnitude speedup on a typical desktop computer, making large-scale simulations more tractable.},

	abstract = {We present an accurate numerical approximation to the Saint-Venant-Hirano model for mixed-sediment morphodynamics in one space dimension. Our solution procedure originates from the fully-unsteady matrix-vector formulation developed in [54]. The principal part of the problem is solved by an explicit Finite Volume upwind method of the path-conservative type, by which all the variables are updated simultaneously in a coupled fashion. The solution to the principal part is embedded into a splitting procedure for the treatment of frictional source terms. The numerical scheme is extended to second-order accuracy and includes a bookkeeping procedure for handling the evolution of size stratification in the substrate. We develop a concept of balancedness for the vertical mass flux between the substrate and active layer under bed degradation, which prevents the occurrence of non-physical oscillations in the grainsize distribution of the substrate. We suitably modify the numerical scheme to respect this principle. We finally verify the accuracy in our solution to the equations, and its ability to reproduce one-dimensional morphodynamics due to streamwise and vertical sorting, using three test cases. In detail, (i) we empirically assess the balancedness of vertical mass fluxes under degradation; (ii) we study the convergence to the analytical linearised solution for the propagation of infinitesimal-amplitude waves [54], which is here employed for the first time to assess a mixed-sediment model; (iii) we reproduce Ribberink�s E8-E9 flume experiment [46].},

There are many reasons to compare maps: (i) to detect temporal/spatial changes or hot-spots, (ii) to compare different models, methodologies or scenarios, (iii) to calibrate, validate land-use models, (iv) to analyse model uncertainty and sensitivity, and (v) to assess map accuracy. This paper addresses the quantification of map similarities and dissimilarities using the Map Comparison Kit (MCK) software. Software and documentation are publicly available on the RIKS website free of charge (http://www.riks.nl/MCK/). The main focus is on �categorical� or �nominal� maps. Four different nominal map-comparison techniques are integrated in the software. Maps on ordinal, ratio and interval scale can be dealt with as well. The software is unique in having two map comparison techniques based on fuzzy-set calculation rules. The rationale is that fuzzy-set map comparison is very close to human judgement. Both fuzziness in location and fuzziness in category definitions are dealt with in the software.},

	abstract = {During the last 30 years, river restoration activities aiming to improve the functionality of degraded fluvial ecosystems increased markedly. For large rivers, it remains difficult to evaluate restoration efficiency and sustainability due to the lack of standardized monitoring metrics. From 2010 to 2016, three gravel augmentations were performed on the Old Rhine, a by-passed reach downstream from the Kembs dam (France- Germany). A geomorphic monitoring combining topo-bathymetric surveys, bedload tracking and hydraulic modelling allows to evaluate the successfulness of these actions. Results show that, to be mobilized, artificial sediment deposit should be located in concavity rather than convexity areas, due to higher shear stresses for moderate floods (Q2). Sediment starvation appeared rapidly on the restored reaches once the sediment wave moved downstream, as a consequence of limited upstream sediment supply. Bathymetric homogenization was observed along and downstream from the restored reaches without creation of new fluvial forms. This research highlights that future actions should include channel enlargement downstream of gravel augmentations, which would promote sediment deposition and habitat diversification. Sediments excavated during artificial widening could be stored and injected progressively into the upstream part of the Old Rhine to benefit the downstream sections.},

	abstract = {The reconstruction of long-term ({\textgreater}100 yr) channel changes is critical to understanding how natural and anthropogenic factors impact the evolution of river systems. It provides information on channel sensitivity and the limitations for channel repair in a functional river restoration context. This study presents a two-century analysis of the evolution of a large braided and anabranching river, the Upper Rhine downstream of Basel, which has experienced three phases of engineering works (nineteenth century channelization, 1930s groyne construction, and 1950s damming and by-passing). We studied historical maps, longitudinal profiles, and cross sections to investigate changes in the areas and geometries of fluvial features from 1828 to 2009. The results showed a drastic floodplain drying out following nineteenth century channelization (93\% reduction of fully connected channels, 48\% augmentation of partially connected channels, augmentation of disconnected water bodies by more than five times, and augmentation of terrestrialized channels of more than two times; 1828–1925). Changes propagated downstream at 280 m yr−1 on the 50-km long river continuum. The channel exhibited bed topography of large forms in 1880, with a median pool-riffle amplitude of 4.0 m, locally reaching 6.6 m. Among the three phases of engineering works on the Upper Rhine, channelization had the most impact on planform (floodplain terrestrialization) and vertical (7 cm yr−1 bed degradation) adjustments, with short reaction times and effects lasting several decades. Damming had the greatest impact on peak flows, and can explain the lower magnitude of the channel changes in the contemporary period. We synthetized the complex cause-effect relationships between natural/anthropogenic controlling factors and hydromorphological processes over the past 200 yr, and outlined the evolutionary trend of the main geomorphic variables, which can be used as a knowledge framework to evaluate future morphodynamic restoration schemes.},

	abstract = {The Huanghe, the second largest river in China, is now under great pressure as a water resource. Using datasets of river water discharge, water consumption and regional precipitation for the past 50 years, we elucidate some connections between decreasing water discharges, global El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and anthropogenic impacts in the drainage basin. Global ENSO events, which directly affected the regional precipitation in the river basin, resulted in approximately 51\% decrease in river water discharge to the sea. The degree of anthropogenic impacts on river water discharge is now as great as that of natural influences, accelerating the water losses in the hydrological cycle. The large dams and reservoirs regulated the water discharge and reduced the peak flows by storing the water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season as needed for agricultural irrigation. Thus, as a result, large dams and reservoirs have shifted the seasonal distribution patterns of water discharge and water consumption and finally resulted in rapidly increasing water consumption. Meanwhile, the annual distribution pattern of water consumption also changed under the regulation of dams and reservoirs, indicating that the people living in the river basin consume the water more and more to suit actual agricultural schedule rather than depending upon natural pattern of annual precipitation. The combination of the increasing water consumption facilitated by the dams and reservoirs and the decreasing precipitation closely associated with the global ENSO events over the past half century has resulted in water scarcity in this world-famous river, as well as in a number of subsequent serious results for the river, delta and coastal ocean.},

	abstract = {The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(mdlogn) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m∼n and d∼logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2×106 edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

Information provided by eyewitnesses via social media is a valuable information source, which should be explored in a{\textasciitilde}more effective way. This research proposes a methodology that leverages social media content to support rapid inundation mapping, including inundation extent and water depth in the case of floods. The novelty of this approach is the utilization of quantitative data that are derived from photos from eyewitnesses extracted from social media posts and their integration with established data. Due to the rapid availability of these posts compared to traditional data sources such as remote sensing data, areas affected by a flood, for example, can be determined quickly. The challenge is to filter the large number of posts to a manageable amount of potentially useful inundation-related information, as well as to interpret and integrate the posts into mapping procedures in a timely manner. To support rapid inundation mapping we propose a methodology and develop "PostDistiller", a tool to filter geolocated posts from social media services which include links to photos. This spatial distributed contextualized in situ information is further explored manually. In an application case study during the June 2013 flood in central Europe we evaluate the utilization of this approach to infer spatial flood patterns and inundation depths in the city of Dresden.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Yet, information necessary to derive exposure in terms of monetary value at the level of individual houses is often not available. This includes building type, size, quality, or age. In this study, we provide a universal method for estimating exposure of residential assets using only publicly available or open data. Using building footprints (polygons) from OpenStreetMap as a starting point, we utilized high-resolution elevation models of 30 European capitals and pan-European raster datasets to construct a Bayesian-network-based model that is able to predict building height. The model was then validated with a dataset of (1) buildings in Poland endangered by sea level rise, for which the number of floors is known, and (2) a sample of Dutch and German houses affected in the past by fluvial and pluvial floods, for which usable floor space area is known. Floor space of buildings is an important basis for approximating their economic value, including household contents. Here, we provide average national-level gross replacement costs of the stock of residential assets in 30 European countries, in nominal and real prices, covering the years 2000–2017. We either relied on existing estimates of the total stock of assets or made new calculations using the perpetual inventory method, which were then translated into exposure per square metre of floor space using data on countries' dwelling stocks. The study shows that the resulting standardized residential exposure values provide much better coverage and consistency compared to previous studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, information about current and future hydro-climatic extremes is often not available. The Future Danube Model (FDM) is an end-user driven multi-hazard and risk model suite for the Danube region that has been developed to provide climate services related to perils such as heavy precipitation, heat waves, floods, and droughts under recent and scenario conditions. As a result, it provides spatially consistent information on extreme events and natural resources throughout the entire Danube catchment. It can be used to quantify climate risks, to support the implementation of the EU framework directives, for climate informed urban and land use planning, water resources management, and for climate proofing of large scale infrastructural planning including cost benefit analysis. The model suite consists of five individual and exchangeable modules: a weather and climate module, a hydrological module, a risk module, an adaptation module, and a web-based visualization module. They are linked in such a way that output from one module can either be used standalone or fed into subsequent modules. The utility of the tool has been tested by experts and stakeholders. The results show that more and more intense hydrological extremes are likely to occur under climate scenario conditions, e.g. higher order floods may occur more frequently.},

	abstract = {Sustainable concepts of ecologically functional rivers challenge engineers, researchers, and planners. Advanced numerical modeling techniques produce nowadays high-precision terrain maps and spatially explicit hydrodynamic data that aid river design. Because of their complexity, however, ecomorphological processes can only be reproduced to a limited extent in numerical models. Intelligent post-processing of hydrodynamic numerical model results still enables ecological river engineering measures to be designed sustainably. We have embedded state-of-the-art concepts in novel algorithms to effectively plan self-maintaining habitat-enhancing design features, such as vegetation plantings or the artificial introduction of streamwood, with high physical stability. The algorithms apply a previously developed lifespan mapping technique and habitat suitability analysis to terraforming and bioengineering river design features. The results not only include analytical synopses, but also provide actively created, automatically generated project plans, which are optimized as a function of an efficiency metric that describes "costs per m² net gain in seasonal habitat area for target species". To make the benefits of these novel algorithms available to a wide audience, we have implemented the codes in an open-source program called River Architect. In this contribution, we present the novel design concepts and algorithms as well as a case study of their application to a river restoration project on the Yuba River in California (USA). With River Architect, we ultimately created an objective, parameter-based, and automated framework for the design of vegetative river engineering features. In addition, we are able to define a framework for stable and ecologically viable terraforming features, but part of the planning of earthworks is still left to expert assessment. Thus, improving the algorithms to plan terraforming of permanent, self-sustaining, and eco-morphodynamic riverbed structures based on site-specific parameters is one of the future challenges.},

However, despite important achievements in this area in the last 10 years, signiﬁcant levels of skill are only generally found over regions strongly connected with the El Nin˜ o–Southern Oscillation. With the aim of improving the skill of regional climate predictions in tropical and extratropical regions from intraseasonal to interannual time scales, a new Met Ofﬁce global seasonal forecasting system (GloSea4) has been developed. This new system has been designed to be ﬂexible and easy to upgrade so it can be fully integrated within the Met Ofﬁce model development infrastructure. Overall, the analysis here shows an improvement of GloSea4 when compared to its predecessor. However, there are exceptions, such as the increased model biases that contribute to degrade the skill of Nin˜ o-3.4 SST forecasts starting in November. Global ENSO teleconnections and Madden–Julian oscillation anomalies are well represented in GloSea4. Remote forcings of the North Atlantic Oscillation by ENSO and the quasi-biennial oscillation are captured albeit the anomalies are weaker than those found in observations. Hindcast length issues and their implications for seasonal forecasting are also discussed.},

The solver is discretized using centroidal Voronoi meshes and a C-grid staggering of the prognostic variables, and it incorporates a split-explicit time-integration technique used in many existing nonhydrostatic meso- and cloud-scale models. MPAS can be applied to the globe, over limited areas of the globe, and on Cartesian planes. The Voronoi meshes are unstructured grids that permit variable horizontal resolution. These meshes allow for applications beyond uniform-resolution NWP and climate prediction, in particular allowing embedded high-resolution regions to be used for regional NWP and regional climate applications. The rationales for aspects of this formulation are discussed, and results from tests for nonhydrostatic flows on Cartesian planes and for large-scale flow on the sphere are presented. The results indicate that the solver is as accurate as existing nonhydrostatic solvers for nonhydrostatic-scale flows, and has accuracy comparable to existing global models using icosahedral (hexagonal) meshes for large-scale flows in idealized tests. Preliminary full-physics forecast results indicate that the solver formulation is robust and that the variable-resolution-mesh solutions are well resolved and exhibit no obvious problems in the mesh-transition zones.},

In this chapter, we discuss the fundamental principles of multi-objective optimization, the differences between multi-objective optimization and single-objective optimization, and describe a few well-known classical and evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization. Two application case studies reveal the importance of multi-objective optimization in practice. A number of research challenges are then highlighted.

Für den Innstauraum Egglfing-Obernberg wurden die dazu erforderlichen Maßnahmen definiert und im Rahmen des von 2017 bis 2019 laufenden Projekts „Durchgängigkeit und Lebensraum“ zum Großteil bereits umgesetzt. Projektinhalte waren die Herstellung eines Insel-Nebenarmsystems einschließlich eines unterstromig angebundenen Stillgewässers in der Stauwurzel, die Dynamisierung und Entlandung von bestehenden Altarmen sowie die Errichtung eines naturnahen Umgehungsgewässers als Fischaufstiegshilfe und hochwertiger Fließgewässerlebensraum. Fischökologische Erhebungen vor Maßnahmenumsetzung bestätigten die hydromorphologischen Defizite des Innstauraums Egglfing-Obernberg, insbesondere das Fehlen hochwertiger Laich- und Juvenilhabitate rheophiler Flussfischarten und die stark eingeschränkte laterale Konnektivität, was sich in quantitativ geringen Fischbeständen und einem Defizit an Arten und Altersstadien äußerte. Allerdings konnte im Zuge dieser Erhebungen mit dem Steingreßling eine im gesamten Salzach-Innsystem ausgestorben geglaubte Fischart wiederentdeckt werden. Erste Untersuchungsergebnisse der herbstlichen Fischmigration im Umgehungsgewässer zeigten ungewöhnlich hohe Aufstiegszahlen verschiedener Cyprinidenarten. Im Rahmen des über die nächsten Jahre laufenden Monitorings soll die Wirkung der Maßnahmen in Hinblick auf die Zielerreichung nach Wasserrahmenrichtlinie untersucht werden, wobei in Analogie zu den Ergebnissen bestehender fischökologischer Studien eine deutliche Stärkung der Fischpopulationen zu erwarten ist.},

	abstract = {Rainfall is one the main drivers of soil erosion. The erosive force of rainfall is expressed as rainfall erosivity. Rainfall erosivity considers the rainfall amount and intensity, and is most commonly expressed as the R-factor in the USLE model and its revised version, RUSLE. At national and continental levels, the scarce availability of data obliges soil erosion modellers to estimate this factor based on rainfall data with only low temporal resolution (daily, monthly, annual averages). The purpose of this study is to assess rainfall erosivity in Europe in the form of the RUSLE R-factor, based on the best available datasets. Data have been collected from 1541 precipitation stations in all European Union (EU) Member States and Switzerland, with temporal resolutions of 5 to 60min. The R-factor values calculated from precipitation data of different temporal resolutions were normalised to R-factor values with temporal resolutions of 30min using linear regression functions. Precipitation time series ranged from a minimum of 5years to a maximum of 40years. The average time series per precipitation station is around 17.1years, the most datasets including the first decade of the 21st century. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has been used to interpolate the R-factor station values to a European rainfall erosivity map at 1km resolution. The covariates used for the R-factor interpolation were climatic data (total precipitation, seasonal precipitation, precipitation of driest/wettest months, average temperature), elevation and latitude/longitude. The mean R-factor for the EU plus Switzerland is 722MJmmha−1h−1yr−1, with the highest values ({\textgreater}1000MJmmha−1h−1yr−1) in the Mediterranean and alpine regions and the lowest ({\textless}500MJmmha−1h−1yr−1) in the Nordic countries. The erosivity density (erosivity normalised to annual precipitation amounts) was also the highest in Mediterranean regions which implies high risk for erosive events and floods.},

	abstract = {Large wood promotes fundamental changes in river hydraulics and morphology, playing a relevant role in river ecology but also in flood hazard. Accurate predictions of large wood dynamics in terms of deposition patterns and travel distance are still lacking and only recently have numerical models been developed to this end. In this work we enhance the capabilities of the numerical model Iber-Wood in reproducing large wood dynamics in shallow braided rivers and validate it by comparing simulations with the results of previous laboratory experiments. The flume experiments provide high-resolution observations of wood travel distances and depositional patterns of wood. The comparison proves useful to improve the numerical simulation of i) the interactions between wood pieces and the river bed (e.g., when wood pieces are transported by dragging); ii) wood pieces with roots, and iii) the formation of wood jams (i.e., accumulations of {\textgreater} 3 wood pieces). A sensitivity analysis reveals the crucial role of bed topography, with limited effect played by drag and restitution coefficients. Taking advantage of a controlled environment with similar simplifying hypotheses, we combine the strengths of both physical and numerical modeling to explore the parameters that are most effective in controlling wood dynamics. We use the numerical model to explore the effect of unsteady flow conditions, with different wood supply input. The resulting wood depositional patterns, jam formation and travel distances during floods may improve our understanding of some of the controls on bio-geomorphic evolutionary trajectories of braided rivers.},

	abstract = {Water resources development and management is imperative for sustainable agriculture in water scarce areas. In Pakistan, the state of Punjab has constructed 32 small dams, in the Pothwar region, to store and conserve water for agricultural production. However, little information is available on the impact of these small dams on agriculture and socio-economic conditions of the area. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of three small dams, Jawa, Kasala and Dhok Sanday Mar, on agriculture and groundwater development in the area and to provide guidelines for the effective utilization and sustainable management of small dams in Pakistan. Data related to on-farm practices were collected during personal interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire. Water-table depth was measured from the open wells in the area with a water-table recorder. Secondary data such as inflow, outflow, rainfall, water charges and land use were collected from small dams organization. After the construction of these dams and irrigation canals, cropping intensity and crop yield have increased. Due to availability of irrigation water there has been a shift of cropping pattern from wheat and forage crops to vegetable crops. Farmers are earning up to \$2433 per ha per year. An analysis of inflow–outflow of the dams shows that, if properly managed, the storage is sufficient to irrigate all the crop lands within the command area. The depth to the water table has also decreased since the dams were constructed. The water table varies from 6 to 15m in the irrigated areas served by the Khasala dam as compared to 7–39m before the dam was constructed. The water table depths for the areas served by the Jawa dam ranged from 7 to 39m before the dam was constructed to 9–25m after construction. The shallower water table has made the groundwater accessible and as a result the number of wells has increased. This has reduced drudgery on the local inhabitants particularly for women who had to fetch water from far away for their domestic uses. The area has potential for expanding both land use and cropping intensities, if innovative irrigation and agronomic practices are adopted. Moreover, mobilizing local water user associations, proper maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and technical support of the agricultural and extension services can enhance the productivity in the area.},

	abstract = {Observed changes in precipitation patterns, rising surface temperature, increases in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, widespread melting of ice, and reduced snow cover are some of the documented hydrologic changes associated with global climate change. Climate change is therefore expected to affect the water supply-demand balance in the Northeast United States and challenge existing water management strategies. The hydrological implications of future climate will affect the design capacity and operating characteristics of dams. The vulnerability of water resources systems to floods and droughts will increase, and the trade-offs between reservoir releases to maintain flood control storage, drought resilience, ecological flow, human water demand, and energy production should be reconsidered. We used a Neural Networks based General Reservoir Operation Scheme to estimate the implications of climate change for dams on a regional scale. This dynamic daily reservoir module automatically adapts to changes in climate and re-adjusts the operation of dams based on water storage level, timing, and magnitude of incoming flows. Our findings suggest that the importance of dams in providing water security in the region will increase. We create an indicator of the Effective Degree of Regulation (EDR) by dams on water resources and show that it is expected to increase, particularly during drier months of year, simply as a consequence of projected climate change. The results also indicate that increasing the size and number of dams, in addition to modifying their operations, may become necessary to offset the vulnerabilities of water resources systems to future climate uncertainties. This is the case even without considering the likely increase in future water demand, especially in the most densely populated regions of the Northeast.},

	abstract = {Nature-based measures (NBMs), understood here as measures such as floodplain restoration that use ecosystem processes to meet societal challenges, are increasingly advocated as promising solutions for managing flood risks. A suitable instrument to implement NBMs are flood risk management plans (FRMPs) stipulated by the EU Floods Directive. While prior research suggests several governance challenges for NBM uptake in FRMPs, little is known so far regarding the actual extent of NBM uptake and its role in decision-making of flood risk management. Germany, with a coherent water policy framework but state-specific implementation conditions, provides a suitable case study for exploring the decision-making practices that are used in the planning process for FRMPs by German federal states with different water governance characteristics. The aim of this study is to analyze the actual uptake of NBMs in German FRMPs, and to explore potential factors of the FRMP preparation and decision-making practices explaining this uptake. Our explorative research design is based on a document analysis method which assesses the contents of FRMPs of three German federal states. The results offer the first empirical evidence of the uptake of NBMs in Germany and insights into how NBMs and other measure types are chosen for FRMPs. Our findings confirm an overall low uptake of NBMs, with diverging preferences for particular NBM types between the three states. Looking across the states, the level of NBM uptake is likely to be higher if rivers with higher stream order are considered in the FRMP's spatial scope, the potential flood risk in a river basin is low, and positive flood impacts and positive cost-benefit ratios are expected. We conclude that FRMPs still hold substantial potential to enhance the NBM uptake in flood risk management planning. To make use of this potential, we suggest three key strategies to increase the change for a better NBM uptake including applying FRMPs at different spatial levels and degrees of details.},

Glider observations suggest the existence of distinct convective chimneys, which carry warmed water to depth with horizontal scales on the order of tens of meters. Patches of photoquenched phytoplankton coincide with patches of anomalously warm water, providing a secondary tracer of water recently in the euphotic zone, and provide insight into the vertical development of convective chimneys. An analysis of the abundance of convective chimneys is used to estimate the lateral scale of convective cells, which appears to be on the order of 50 m.},

Most obviously, ecosystems can provide us with material things that are essential for our daily lives, such as food, wood, wool and medicines. Although the other types of benefit we get from ecosystems are easily overlooked, they also play an important role in regulating the environments in which we live. They can help ensure the flow of clean water and protect us from flooding or other hazards like soil erosion, land-slips and tsunamis. They can contribute to our spiritual well-being, through their cultural or religious significance or the opportunities they provide for recreation and the enjoyment of nature.In this chapter, we will look at the goods and services that ecosystems can provide and the role that biodiversity may play in producing them, specifically the contribution that biodiversity makes to people's livelihoods, to their security and to their health. In other words, we will concentrate mainly on the utilitarian value of biodiversity. We will also explore how these ideas link up with those of the Ecosystem Approach to environmental management and policy, and some of the implications of this for how sustainable development is defined.},

	abstract = {1. Stream ecosystems are increasingly impacted by multiple stressors that lead to a loss of sensitive species and an overall reduction in diversity. A dominant paradigm in ecological restoration is that increasing habitat heterogeneity (HH) promotes restoration of biodiversity. This paradigm is reflected in stream restoration projects through the common practice of re-configuring channels to add meanders and adding physical structures such as boulders and artificial riffles to restore biodiversity by enhancing structural heterogeneity. 2. To evaluate the validity of this paradigm, we completed an extensive evaluation of published studies that have quantitatively examined the reach-scale response of invertebrate species richness to restoration actions that increased channel complexity/HH. We also evaluated studies that used manipulative or correlative approaches to test for a relationship between physical heterogeneity and invertebrate diversity in streams that were not in need of restoration. 3. We found habitat and macroinvertebrate data for 78 independent stream or river restoration projects described by 18 different author groups in which invertebrate taxa richness data in response to the restoration treatment were available. Most projects were successful in enhancing physical HH; however, only two showed statistically significant increases in biodiversity rendering them more similar to reference reaches or sites. 4. Studies manipulating structural complexity in otherwise healthy streams were generally small in scale and less than half showed a significant positive relationship with invertebrate diversity. Only one-third of the studies that attempted to correlate biodiversity to existing levels of in-stream heterogeneity found a positive relationship. 5. Across all the studies we evaluated, there is no evidence that HH was the primary factor controlling stream invertebrate diversity, particularly in a restoration context. The findings indicate that physical heterogeneity should not be the driving force in selecting restoration approaches for most degraded waterways. Evidence suggests that much more must be done to restore streams impacted by multiple stressors than simply re-configuring channels and enhancing structural complexity with meanders, boulders, wood, or other structures. 6. Thematic implications: as integrators of all activities on the land, streams are sensitive to a host of stressors including impacts from urbanisation, agriculture, deforestation, invasive species, flow regulation, water extractions and mining. The impacts of these individually or in combination typically lead to a decrease in biodiversity because of reduced water quality, biologically unsuitable flow regimes, dispersal barriers, altered inputs of organic matter or sunlight, degraded habitat, etc. Despite the complexity of these stressors, a large number of stream restoration projects focus primarily on physical channel characteristics. We show that this is not a wise investment if ecological recovery is the goal. Managers should critically diagnose the stressors impacting an impaired stream and invest resources first in repairing those problems most likely to limit restoration.},

	abstract = {The functional flows model integrates hydrogeomorphic processes and ecological functions for stream physical habitat evaluations. Functional flows are discharge values that serve ecological uses. Assessments of functional flows are based on evaluation of shear stress dynamics. The analysis is based on the occurrence of sediment transport regimes defined by threshold values of Shields stress estimated from discharge (Q), a parameter (f) governing depth response to incremental discharge changes, water surface slope (S) and media grain size (D50). As an example, the model was tuned for fall-run Chinook salmon spawning. Ecological functions studied were bed occupation (spawning, incubation and emergence) and bed preparation (river bed reworking periods)—both reliant on shear stress dynamics. A numerical experiment and sensitivity analysis using a wide range of realistic values of input variables indicated the effect of each variable on flow functionality. Combinations of S = 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01, D50 = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 m, f = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and four sediment transport stages produced 144 scenarios. Ranges of functional flows were greater for scenarios for low f (0.2) with low slope (0.001,0.05), for high f (0.5) with small grain size (0.02 m) and for intermediate low f (0.3) with coarse grain size (0.1 m). The functional flows model incorporates in-stream habitat processes by including metrics of hydrologic, hydraulic, geomorphic and ecologic dynamics. Model uncertainties related to input data, calculation algorithms, and model structure are analysed. Functional flows analysis can be useful in studying water management alternatives to improve habitat conditions for target species and lifestages. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The habitat utilization data were used to develop habitat suitability functions that provide input variables to the instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) habitat assessment model of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Observations of habitat utilization of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were obtained during the summer months of 1983 and 1984. The observations were made in small streams with discharges ranging from 0.7 m3 s−1 to 0.03 m3 s−1. The streams are at elevations of 1250 to 2530 m. Equal effort was applied to observing undisturbed trout in all habitat types. Snorkeling proved to be the most effective method of observation. Individual trout of all species and life stages were most often observed in the lower half of the water column, utilizing low-velocity currents of less than 3.0 cm s−1. From the depth and velocity utilization data, several forms of habitat suitability functions were developed and evaluated: 1 Univariate depth and velocity functions derived from frequency histogram analysis. 2 Univariate depth and univariate velocity exponential polynomial models. 3 Bivariate depth and velocity exponential polynomial models. Univariate exponential polynomial models provided the best fit to the data for each species, based on visual comparisons of response surfaces and contour plots, and comparisons of computed sums of squared errors. Bivariate models fitted to the data resulted in greater sums of squared errors than multiplicative aggragation of univariate models, and frequently predicted utilization at zero depth. The habitat suitability functions derived from the univariate exponential polynomial models provided the best input to the IFIM habitat assessment models.},

A formal statistical model is presented for the release of smolts marked with coded-wire tags (CWTs) in the lower Sacramento River and the subsequent recovery of marked smolts in midwater trawls in the Delta. This model treats survival as a logistic function of water temperature, and the release and recovery of different CWT groups as independent mark–recapture experiments. Iteratively reweighted least squares is used to fit the model to the data, and simulation is used to establish confidence intervals for the fitted parameters. A 95\% confidence interval for the upper incipient lethal temperature, inferred from the trawl data by this method, is 23.01 ± 1.08 °C This is in good agreement with published experimental results obtained under controlled conditions (24.3 ± 0.1 and 25.1 ± 0.1 °C for chinook salmon acclimatized to 10 and 20 °C, respectively): this agreement has implications for the applicability of laboratory findings to natural systems.},

In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, ‘Metapopulation Persistence’ focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical (e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the ‘Water Filtration’ optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for ‘Metapopulation Persistence,’ as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1\% of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., “win-win” locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., “tradeoff” locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefits.},

	abstract = {Living in an aquatic environment, often devoid of light but rich in dissolved compounds, fish have highly developed chemosensory and chemical signalling systems. The olfactory and gustatory systems comprise the major chemosensory pathways. Despite considerable variations in structural organization of the peripheral olfactory organ throughout fish species, ultrastructural organization of the olfactory sensory epithelium is extremely consistent. The olfactory receptor cell is a bipolar neurone which is directly exposed to the external environment and sends information to the brain by its own axon (cranial nerve I). Four major classes of chemicals have been identified as specific olfactory stimuli and their stimulatory effectiveness characterized: amino acids, sex steroids, bile acids/salts and prostaglandins. Olfactory signals such as those involved in reproduction and feeding may be processed independently through two distinct subsystems: the lateral and medial olfactory systems. The taste buds constitute the structural basis of the gustatory organ. Taste buds may occur not only in the oropharyngeal cavity, but on the whole body surface. Chemical information detected by specialized epithelial cells, gustatory cells, is transmitted to the central nervous system by cranial nerve VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), and X (vagal). Besides diverse sensitivities and specificities for amino acids, fish gustatory receptors detect various organic acids, nucleotides and bile salts. Putative receptors, molecular mechanisms of transduction and the role played by olfaction and gustation in feeding, reproduction, migration and other fish behaviours are discussed.},

(1) set out to meet the needs of policymakers and earth-system modelers to better understand the future of soil erosion this century. Policymakers need this insight because of the constraints erosion places on achievement of multiple sustainable development goals including zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, no poverty, and life on land (2). The record of humankind does not induce confidence, evidencing our effect on soil distribution and quality and the consequences for past civilizations (3). The impact that soil erosion and deposition has on biogeochemical cycles (4⇓–6) is leading to a recognition that earth-system models (ESMs) must look beyond vertical exchanges between soil and atmosphere and address carbon cycle perturbation cause by lateral transport of soil from land to ocean (7). The study by Borrelli et al. (1) is, therefore, timely.

Research, dating back as far as the 1930s and the stimulus of the Dust Bowl, has provided valuable insights into the causes and consequences of soil erosion. However, global synthesis of erosion rates measured using a wide range of methodologies, has proven to be extremely challenging (8). By applying an empirical soil erosion model employing consistent and high spatial resolution global datasets, Borrelli et al. (1) address this challenge and offer simulations that can be coupled in a consistent manner to land use, soil conservation, and climate change scenarios. Comparing modeled soil erosion for 2015 and 2070, Borrelli et al. (1) identify potential for ∼10\% reduction in global rates under a sustainability-focused scenario (SSP1-RCP2.6), ∼10\% increase in global rates for a fossil-fuel intensive scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5), and relatively little change (+2\%) for an intermediate scenario (SSP2-RCP4.5). These results suggest cobenefits for erosion reduction in attempts to pursue a path …

Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {Stream biophysical processes are commonly studied using multi-dimensional numerical modelling that quantifies flow hydraulics from which parameters such as habitat suitability, stream carrying capacity, and bed mobility are derived. These analyses would benefit from accurate high-resolution stream bathymetries spanning tens of kilometres of channel, especially in small streams or where navigation is difficult. Traditional ground-based survey methods are limited by survey time, dense vegetation and stream access, and are usually only feasible for short reaches. Conversely, airborne topobathymetric LiDAR surveys may overcome these limitations, although limited research is available on how errors in LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) might propagate through flow models. This study investigated the performance of LiDAR-derived topobathymetry in support of multi-dimensional flow modelling and ecohydraulics calculations in two gravel-bedded reaches (approximately 200 m long), one morphologically complex and one morphologically simple, and at the segment scale (32 km-long stream segment) along a 15 m-wide river in central Idaho, USA. We compared metre and sub-metre-resolution DEMs generated from RTK-GPS ground and Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR-B (EAARL-B) surveys and water depths, velocities, shear stresses, habitat suitability, and bed mobility modelled with two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models supported by LiDAR and ground-surveyed DEMs. Residual statistics, bias (B), and standard deviation (SD) of the residuals between depth and velocity predicted from the model supported by LiDAR and ground-survey topobathymetries were up to −0.04 (B) and 0.09 m (SD) for depth and −0.09 (B) and 0.20 m s−1 (SD) for velocity. The accuracy (B = 0.05 m), precision (SD = 0.09 m), and point density (1 point m−2) of the LiDAR topobathymetric survey (regardless of reach complexity) were sufficient to support 2D hydrodynamic modelling and derivative stream habitat and process analyses, because these statistics were comparable to those of model calibration with B = 0 m and SD = 0.04 m for water surface elevation and B = 0.05 m s−1 and SD = 0.22 m s−1 for velocity in our investigation. © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fishes are appropriate indicators of trends in aquatic biodiversity because their enormous variety reflects a wide range of environmental conditions. Fish also have a major impact on the distribution and abundance of other organisms in waters they inhabit. Examination of trends in freshwater fish faunas from different parts of the world indicate that most faunas are in serious decline and in need of immediate protection. Species most likely to be threatened with immediate extinction are either specialized for life in large rivers or are endemic species with very small distributions. We conservatively estimate that 20 percent of the freshwater fish species of the world (ca. 1800 species) are already extinct or in serious decline. Evidence for serious declines in marine fishes is limited largely to estuarine fishes, reflecting their dependence on freshwater inflows, or to fishes in inland seas. The proximate causes of fish species’ decline can be divided into five broad categories: (1) competition for water, (2) habitat alteration, (3) pollution, (4) introduction of exotic species, and (5) commercial exploitation. Although one or two principal causes of decline can be identified for each species, the decline is typically the result of multiple, cumulative, long-term effects. Ways to protect aquatic biodiversity include the implementation of landscape-level management strategies, the creation of aquatic preserves, and the restoration of degraded aquatic habitats. Without rapid adoption of such measures we are likely to experience an accelerated rate of extinctions in aquatic environments as human populations continue to expand.},

Overfishing and other human influences are reducing the diversity and abundance of fish worldwide, but the ecosystem-level consequences of these changes have not been assessed quantitatively. Recycling of nutrients is one important ecosystem process that is directly influenced by fish. Fish species vary widely in the rates at which they excrete nitrogen and phosphorus; thus, altering fish communities could affect nutrient recycling. Here, we use extensive field data on nutrient recycling rates and population sizes of fish species in a Neotropical river and Lake Tanganyika, Africa, to evaluate the effects of simulated extinctions on nutrient recycling. In both of these species-rich ecosystems, recycling was dominated by relatively few species, but contributions of individual species differed between nitrogen and phosphorus. Alternative extinction scenarios produced widely divergent patterns. Loss of the species targeted by fishermen led to faster declines in nutrient recycling than extinctions in order of rarity, body size, or trophic position. However, when surviving species were allowed to increase after extinctions, these compensatory responses had strong moderating effects even after losing many species. Our results underscore the complexity of predicting the consequences of extinctions from species-rich animal communities. Nevertheless, the importance of exploited species in nutrient recycling suggests that overfishing could have particularly detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning.},

Via excretory processes, animals can supply nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) at rates comparable to major nutrient sources, and nutrient cycling by animals can support a substantial proportion of the nutrient demands of primary producers. In addition, animals may exert strong impacts on the species composition of primary producers via effects on nutrient supply rates and ratios. Animals can either recycle nutrients within a habitat, or translocate nutrients across habitats or ecosystems. Nutrient translocation by relatively large animals may be particularly important for stimulating new primary production and for increasing nutrient standing stocks in recipient habitats. Animals also have numerous indirect effects on nutrient fluxes via effects on their prey or by modification of the physical environment. Future studies must quantify how the importance of animal-mediated nutrient cycling varies among taxa and along environmental gradients such as ecosystem size and productivity.},

Hundreds of millions of people around the world benefit from low-cost protein, recreation, and commerce provided by freshwater fisheries, particularly in regions where alternative sources of nutrition and employment are scarce. Here, we derive a gridded global map of riverine fisheries and assess its implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. Catches increase with river discharge and human population density, and 90\% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Fish richness and catches are positively but not causally correlated, revealing that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. Merging our catch analysis with nutritional and socioeconomic data, we find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. Poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. The spatial coincidence of productive freshwater fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers and lakes in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity.},

	url = {https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0357031},
	abstract = {Vegetation structure is an important biodiversity indicator providing biological and physical environment that supports and maintains forest biodiversity. The airborne lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) systems have the advantage of directly measuring three-dimensional vegetation structure, and have been widely used in wildlife habitat mapping and species distribution modeling at the local scales. As lidar data are increasingly compiled into broad spatial coverage, the development of structural inventory and indicators to categorize habitat types and identify important patches would be beneficial to regional-level conservation planning and biodiversity monitoring. However, this area of research has not been adequately explored. Large-area mapping of critical habitat patches is also a fundamental step towards modeling habitat connectivity. Quantification and dynamic modeling of habitat connectivity under long-term influence of land cover change events provide insights into forest management and conservation planning, and including climate change constraints into the modeling framework also helps maintain ecosystem integrity and improve conservation effectiveness.

Therefore, the objectives of this thesis are to 1) characterize vegetation structure and identify important habitat patches with critical structural traits using regional lidar dataset, and 2) build habitat networks to model connectivity dynamics under land cover change events. To do this, first, a novel approach using cluster analysis to process large-area lidar data into categorical classes representing natural groupings of habitat structure was applied to derive eight unique structure classes in the managed forested area in Alberta, Canada. Second, the structure classes indicating high levels of structure complexity combined with Landsat-derived forest cover types were used to identify important habitat patches to develop habitat networks. Lastly, spatial prioritization schemes based on different aspects of connectivity and climate constraints were generated and implemented through scenario-based simulations of land cover change events. Connectivity dynamics through the simulations were assessed and compared between scenarios. The result showed that the conservation strategies considering both habitat area and habitat spatial configuration were best at maintaining habitat connectivity, and taking climate constraints into consideration didn’t affect overall connectivity. Overall, this research provides an integrated approach to characterize habitat structure using large-area lidar data for dynamic connectivity modeling following land cover change simulations.},

	abstract = {Hydrologic and geomorphic classifications have gained traction in response to the increasing need for basin-wide water resources management. Regardless of the selected classification scheme, an open scientific challenge is how to extend information from limited field sites to classify tens of thousands to millions of channel reaches across a basin. To address this spatial scaling challenge, this study leverages machine learning to predict reach-scale geomorphic channel types using publicly available geospatial data. A bottom-up machine learning approach selects the most accurate and stable model among 20,000 combinations of 287 coarse geospatial predictors, preprocessing methods, and algorithms in a three-tiered framework to (i) define a tractable problem and reduce predictor noise, (ii) assess model performance in statistical learning, and (iii) assess model performance in prediction. This study also addresses key issues related to the design, interpretation, and diagnosis of machine learning models in hydrologic sciences. In an application to the Sacramento River basin (California, USA), the developed framework selects a Random Forest model to predict 10 channel types previously determined from 290 field surveys over 108,943 two hundred-meter reaches. Performance in statistical learning is reasonable with a 61\% median cross-validation accuracy, a sixfold increase over the 10\% accuracy of the baseline random model, and the predictions coherently capture the large-scale geomorphic organization of the landscape. Interestingly, in the study area, the persistent roughness of the topography partially controls channel types and the variation in the entropy-based predictive performance is explained by imperfect training information and scale mismatch between labels and predictors.},

Because stranding is dependent on a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, it is difficult to accurately identify and parameterize fish stranding risks for various river topographies, fish species/lifestages and flow ramping scenarios. This article presents a literature review, new concepts and a novel Python3 algorithm for post-processing two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model results to identify spatially explicit locations where fish stranding is likely, such as but not limited to downstream of hydropeaking facilities. Compared to previous stranding algorithms, this one is novel in its use of graph theory to find optimal fish escape routes and for its embedding in the free, open-source river analysis software River Architect. Guided by biological parameter selection and supplied with two-dimensional hydrodynamic model rasters, River Architect's Stranding Risk module is suitable for characterization of existing pool stranding risks, alternative flow regime and topographic design evaluation and post-project assessment of rivers during flow recessions.},

	abstract = {Ecohydraulics often requires the use of advanced numerical models and ecological theories, which are used for river and aquatic organism management. In this study, a 2D ecohydraulic model system was proposed and used to evaluate the habitat suitability index, weighted useable areas, overall suitability index, fish population number, and fish population density of Colorado River. The 2D ecohydraulic model system comprised hydrodynamic, hydromorphology, habitat, and population models. Three fish species were selected as target fish, which included rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis). Five computational domains of the Colorado River were selected for the ecohydraulic model. The surveyed fish data from 2000 to 2009 were used to calibrate the model system. Results indicated that the predicted fish number showed a good agreement with the surveyed fish. It is indicated that the rainbow trout and brown trout fish number showed decreasing trends from 2000 to 2009, while flannelmouth sucker showed increasing trend from 2000 to 2009. The proposed approach demonstrates that the ecohydraulic model system can be used to accurately simulate the river habitat quality and population status. The ecohydraulic model can be an efficient tool to improve understanding of the different scenarios and to assistant for multiple fish habitat and population prediction in river system. It can also provide decision-makers with valuable information to optimize their management.},

When tested, the metrics used to evaluate these models are often limited by the methods used to develop them. More generalized bioverification strategies that transcend methodology are therefore needed in ecohydraulics. This study further developed and applied such a generalized bioverification framework to four approximately 1-m-resolution rearing salmonid microhabitat suitability models. Water depth and velocity habitat suitability criteria (HSC) functions were developed for two size classes of rearing Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. mykiss using snorkel survey data collected over three years at seven sites along the lower Yuba River in California, USA. An expert-based cover HSC function was modified from previous studies. HSC functions were applied to previously validated, approximately 1-m-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamic models and cover maps of the river. Mann–Whitney U tests confirmed that suitability values were significantly higher at utilized locations compared to randomly generated, non-utilized locations for all four models. Bootstrapped forage ratios demonstrated that microhabitat suitability models accurately predicted both preferred and avoided habitat beyond the 95\% confidence level. This generalized bioverification framework is recommended for evaluating and comparing the accuracy and reliability of ecohydraulic models used in habitat management worldwide.},

	abstract = {Spawning substrate quality is a major factor influencing the early ontogeny of European nase (Chondrostoma nasus), a target species of conservation. Analogous to findings from salmonids, restoration of spawning grounds was hypothesized to enhance spawning, development and thus recruitment success of nase, by improving the substrate quality, and subsequently spawning site use, egg infiltration and protection of larvae in the interstitial zones before emergence. These assumptions were tested using a comparative approach by cleaning 50\% of the area of each spawning ground in two Bavarian rivers. Substrate cleaning resulted in an immediate reduction of 70\% fine sediment content with improvements still detectable 2 months later. Spawning nase used the restored areas of spawning grounds preferentially, which was evident in the number of spawning fish and the significantly higher number of eggs laid. Infiltration of eggs into the interstitial zone was distinctly more successful in the opened interstices of the cleaned spawning substrate, where they were found down to a depth of 20 cm. The same was true for larvae, which could be found down to 30 cm and up to 13 days after hatching. Moreover, higher peaks in the drift density of emerging larvae from the restored spawning substrate were detected (2.5 compared with 1.7 larvae m−3 discharge for the River Mangfall and 0.3 compared with 0.03 larvae m−3 for the River Sims). These results clearly indicate that gravel cleaning is a successful short-term restoration tool for nase spawning grounds. It is a quick, cheap and effective method for the conservation management of nase, which may also be applicable to other riverine species with a similiar ecology and incubation time, such as Barbus barbus, Squalius cephalus, Leuciscus leuciscus and Phoxinus phoxinus. This especially holds true if streams lack internal dynamics and suffer from high loads of fine sediment and colmation.},

Although mathematical predictors can be used for estimation, they do not adequately represent porosities. The objective of this study was to assess a new approach for the determination of porosity of frozen sediment samples. The method is based on volume determination by applying Structure-from-Motion with Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) to estimate a 3D volumetric model based on overlapping imagery. The method was applied on artificial sediment mixtures as well as field samples. In addition, the commonly used water replacement method was applied to determine porosities in comparison with the SfM-MVS method. We examined a range of porosities from 0.16 to 0.46 that are representative of the wide range of porosities found in rivers. SfM-MVS performed well in determining volumes of the sediment samples. A very good correlation (r = 0.998, p {\textless} 0.0001) was observed between the SfM-MVS and the water replacement method. Results further show that the water replacement method underestimated total sample volumes. A comparison with several mathematical predictors showed that for non-uniform samples the calculated porosity based on the standard deviation performed better than porosities based on the median grain size. None of the predictors were effective at estimating the porosity of the field samples.},

	abstract = {In the present work, we verified a 3D computational fluid dynamics model for vertical slot fish-passes (VSFs) that employs the renormalization-group k-epsilon turbulence model (RNG KE) and the volume of fluid (VOF) method. We compared model calculations with experiments in two pool designs T1 and T2 of an experimental VSF and with 2D calculations using the shallow water equations (SWE) and the standard k-epsilon (2D SKE) model. Calculations of the 3D model showed (1) good agreement with experiments and 2D calculations in predicting mean flow velocities, (2) better performance in the determination of the water surface in the VSF, which is attributed to the accurate VOF method, (3) superior prediction of turbulence characteristics than the 2D model, which is due to the 3D RNG KE model that overcomes the problem of turbulence overestimation of the 2D SKE model, and to the fact that the 3D model takes into account the 3D features of the flow in the fish pass. Moreover, the present 3D calculations showed that the common assumptions in VSFs that (1) the flow is 2D, and (2) the simulation of 4 pools of a VSF is sufficient to obtain satisfactory results, are not always valid. Flow can be considered as 2D only in pool design T2 and for certain geometries and flow characteristics in pool design T1; while, eventually, all the pools of a fish pass need to be modeled to ensure accurate results. Finally, the present work illustrates the need to perform fish experiments simultaneously with flow experiments.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the performance of numerical models of coastal morphology against observations is an essential part of establishing their credibility. In the past, this has usually been done by comparing predicted with observed behavior, and the modeler making a subjective judgement of the goodness of fit. By contrast, meteorological models have been tested for many years against observations using objective, scientifically rigorous methods. Drawing on the analogy between distributions of atmospheric pressure (and similar scalars) and coastal bathymetry, the meteorological statistical methods are here adapted to coastal applications. A set of criteria is proposed that identify the desirable attributes of statistical measures of the performance of coastal morphological models. Various statistical parameters used in the meteorological field are described, dealing both with cases in which the model outputs comprise a small number of categories (e.g., advance/equilibrium/retreat of shoreline), and those in which they are continuous (e.g., bathymetry). Examples of the application of these methods are given, in terms of both hypothetical illustrations, and real field data and model predictions. Following meteorological practice, it is shown that measuring the skill of a model (i.e., its performance relative to a simple baseline predictor) is a more critical test than measuring its absolute accuracy. The attributes of the different performance measures are compared with the proposed desirable criteria, and those that match them best are selected. These are the LEPSOB test for categorical data, and the Brier Skill Score (BSS) for continuous data. Routine use of these measures of performance would aid inter-comparability of models, and be a step toward strengthening user confidence in the predictions of coastal numerical models.},

	url = {http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/265753},
	abstract = {Dams store water and trap sediment in their reservoirs. Downstream river segments, hence, are affected by a limited sediment dynamics. This becomes obvious by river bed incision, limited geomorphological variability and depletion of hydraulic habitats for in-stream ecological organisms. Replenishment is a measure to counteract the lack of sediment. In segments dams such a sediment replenishment can be combined with the release of an
artificial flood, by activating spillways and bottom outlets. Recent laboratory studies revealed the potential of multi-deposit replenishment configuration towards an increase of geomorphological richness in the river. However, this has not yet been tested in the field.

The hydro-morphological index of diversity (HMID), is based on the spatial variability flow depth and velocity in a river segment, allowing the quantification of the change in morphology such a measure. Its ease in computation and its objectivity makes the index a useful tool for a large variety of users. However, knowledge concerning data sufficiency and a standardized sampling procedure does not exist. Further, the HMID does not account for temporal variability.

This research aims at closing these gaps of knowledge for a sustainable management of complex floodplains downstream of dams.

Flow depth and velocity data from 19 river segments were analyzed with the HMID. Structured sub-sampling and analysis of the data revealed different data sufficiency depending on the complexity of the river geomorphology. A representative HMID value is computed from at least 100 datapoints distributed over eight cross-sections, in braided rivers more datapoints are required.

The geomorphological changes by an artificial flood event in the Sarine were analyzed with the HMID. In the impact perimeter of the multi-deposit sediment replenishment, the HMID increased by 36 \% in the Sarine, in the rest of the river 18 \%. A similar study was investigated at the Spöl, pointing out that sediment availability is crucial for the hydraulic habitat diversity.

With the help of 489 tracer stones, the movement of the replenished sediment was investigated in detail. The deposition pattern results in repeating sediment clusters on the riverbed, as it was observed in the laboratory experiments. For the two characteristic diameters, the tracers allowed the estimation of transport velocities of 19 cm/min (dm = 57 mm) and 28 cm/min (d90 = 113 mm) during the flood event and consequently the erosion efficiency of the different parts of the flood hydrograph.

Macroinvertebrates were less affected by the artificial flood event in the hydropeaking river segment of the Sarine compared with the residual flow segment. The species diversity indices decreased significantly due to the artificial flood event. A direct link between flow regime and EPT richness was observed. A river with a natural flow regime hosts the highest richness of macroinvertebrates followed the residual and finally the hydropeaking flow regime. For other ecological indicators, additional physical river parameters for example the frequency duration curve or the grain size distribution need to be considered as well.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, many rivers are affected by various river engineering measures and exhibit ecological deficits as a result. Sediment input from upstream is often limited by the presence of hydropower plants, sediment retention basins, and other river training measures, resulting in a lack of bed-load and morphological degradation. Sediment deficit can undermine structures, negatively influence groundwater formation, and decrease habitat quality for aquatic flora and fauna. Sediment replenishment by means of artificial gravel deposits or enhanced by bank erosion are two options when attempting to compensate for sediment deficits in rivers and to improve their ecological conditions. The ability to predict bank erosion rates and their impact on the river reach are important when attempting to implement restoration projects successfully.  In the first part of this study, experiments are conducted on the erosion pattern of artificial gravel deposits to (i) investigate the influence of the governing parameters on the erosion process of gravel deposits, (ii) improve understanding of fluvial bank erosion in case of non-cohesive, granular bank material, and (iii) identify the fundamentals  to implement and improve bank erosion in numerical models. In a second test series, the ability of non-submerged structures to enhance bank erosion is evaluated. Erodible and non-erodible structures are tested to obtain bank erosion volumes that are favourable from river engineering and ecological perspectives. In a third test series, the long-term evolution of the bed of a typical Swiss river as a result of changing sediment supply is investigated. Predicting equations intended to describe the erosion pattern of artificial gravel deposits and to estimate the backwater rise that occurs due to gravel deposits are proposed. This study demonstrates that an excess shear stress relation can describe the temporal evolution of the mean erosion rate of an artificial gravel deposit.  Non-erodible structures perpendicular to a river’s bank and groins on the opposite bank are efficient to enhance bank erosion for discharges where no or negligible bank erosion occurs without a structure being present. The introduction of large wood debris jams is a promising option for enhancing bank erosion, as this approach combines low maintenance requirements with the immediate creation of complex habitats. In the third test series, channel responses to a long-term change in sediment supply took the form of a combination of (i) an adjustment on the grain scale by a smoothening of the bed; (ii) a change of the cross-sectional shape by sediment deposition, primarily in the thalweg; and (iii) and a reduction of the longitudinal bed slope.  This study’s findings allow for improved predictions of the rate and magnitude of bank erosion and their subsequent impact on the downstream river reach; thus, they can consequently aid in determining design frequency and deposit volumes for planned restoration projects.},

We propose \textit{GRAINet}, a data-driven approach to analyze grain size distributions of entire gravel bars based on georeferenced UAV images. A convolutional neural network is trained to regress grain size distributions as well as the characteristic mean diameter from raw images. \textit{GRAINet} allows the holistic analysis of entire gravel bars, resulting in (i) high-resolution maps of the spatial grain size distribution at large scale, and (ii) robust grading curves for entire gravel bars. To collect a large training dataset of 1,491 samples, we introduce \textit{digital line sampling} as a new annotation strategy, following the widely applied line sampling analysis of Fehr (1987). Our evaluation on 25 gravel bars along 6 different rivers in Switzerland yields high accuracy: The resulting maps of mean diameters have a mean absolute error of 1.1\&thinsp;cm, with no bias. Robust grading curves for entire gravel bars can be extracted if representative training data is available. At the gravel bar level the MAE error of the predicted mean diameter is even reduced to 0.3\&thinsp;cm. Extensive experiments were carried out to study the quality of the digital line samples, the generalization capability of \textit{GRAINet} to new locations, the model performance w.r.t. human labeling noise, the limitations of the current model, and the potential of \textit{GRAINet} to analyze images with low resolutions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Dams fragment river systems worldwide, and Mediterranean-climate rivers, characterised by highly seasonal hydrographs and adapted biotas, are particularly impacted by flow regulation. Whereas the effects of flow regulation on hydrology, sediment transport and biodiversity have long been examined, responses at the food-web level remain understudied. Environmental variation is a key control of food-web structure. Thus, we predicted that flow regulation would impact food-chain length (FCL) via changes in the flow variation regime, and we tested this prediction in a set of flow unregulated to completely regulated reaches in a Mediterranean river basin. In each reach, we characterised flow variation, together with two other putative controls of FCL (productivity and habitat size). We combined community data with carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to estimate food-chain length, and Bayesian mixing models allowed estimates of dietary proportions of consumers. Flow variation was paramount in controlling FCL in the studied river network, and this same control largely explained the degree of omnivory among top predators. Thus, omnivory mechanisms were the main proximate structural mechanism allowing shifts in food-web structure and linking disturbance regimes to FCL. Our results suggest that flow regulation in Mediterranean rivers may impact food-web structure even when no significant changes in community composition are observed. If highly variable Mediterranean streams become increasingly affected by flow regulation, the resulting more stable conditions could enhance intraguild predation and thus lengthen riverine food chains.},

Recent advances in the field of stable isotope ecology allow the estimation of food chain length (FCL) from stable nitrogen isotope (δ15N) data. We conducted a global literature synthesis and estimated FCL for 219 lake, stream, and marine ecosystems. Streams had shorter food chains (∼3.5 trophic levels) than marine and lake ecosystems (∼4.0 trophic levels). In marine systems, inclusion of marine mammals increased FCL by 2/3 of a trophic level. For each ecosystem type, estimates of FCL were normally distributed and spanned two full trophic levels. Comparison with published connectance food webs revealed similar mean FCL values, though stable isotope-derived FCL estimates were less variable. At the global scale, FCL showed weak or no relationships with ecosystem size, mean annual air temperature, or latitude. Our study highlights the utility of stable isotopes for quantifying among-system food web variability, and the application of this approach for assessing global-scale patterns of food chain length.},

	abstract = {Given the limited resources available for managing erosion hazards and addressing water quality impairment along rivers, stakeholders engaged in water resource management would benefit from tools to identify those river reaches most prone to adjustment and which disproportionately load sediment to receiving waters. The extent and rate of vertical and lateral channel adjustments in response to natural and human disturbances vary considerably across space and time; and this complexity and nonlinearity introduce challenges for classification or modelling of river reaches using conventional statistical techniques. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a data-driven computational tool with advantages for clustering or classifying multivariate observations and for exploratory data analysis and visualization of complex, nonlinear systems. We applied a SOM to cluster multivariate stream geomorphic assessment data into reach-scale sediment process domains for 193 river reaches in glacially-conditioned catchments of northeastern US using field- and GIS-derived hydraulic and geomorphic parameters. The reaches comprised a range of channel types from confined to unconfined, steep- to shallow-gradient, mid-to-high order, and bedrock to alluvial channels. Fifteen variables were identified that meaningfully separated reaches into seven sediment regimes, following a two-stage application of the SOM. A coarse-tune SOM identified sediment regime classes at the supply-limited and transport-limited extremes of a continuum, including bedrock channels and confined, steep-gradient reaches as well as braided, depositional channels at alluvial fan or delta settings. A second-stage, fine-tune SOM nuanced differences in sediment production and transport for unconfined reaches with varying degrees of floodplain disconnection resulting from natural or human stressors. This classification framework is transferable to other hydroclimatic regions, with consideration of additional or alternate independent variables unique to those regions, and can provide valuable insights for river management to promote flood resiliency, restore water quality and improve instream and riparian habitats.},

	abstract = {Microbial biofilms assemble from cells that attach to a surface, where they develop into matrix-enclosed communities. Mechanistic insights into community assembly are crucial to better understand the functioning of natural biofilms, which drive key ecosystem processes in numerous aquatic habitats. We studied the role of the suspended microbial community as the source of the biofilm community in three streams using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the 16S rRNA gene (as a measure for the active and the bulk community, respectively). Diversity was consistently lower in the biofilm communities than in the suspended stream water communities. We propose that the higher diversity in the suspended communities is supported by continuous inflow from various sources within the catchment. Community composition clearly differed between biofilms and suspended communities, whereas biofilm communities were similar in all three streams. This suggests that biofilm assembly did not simply reflect differences in the source communities, but that certain microbial groups from the source community proliferate in the biofilm. We compared the biofilm communities with random samples of the respective community suspended in the stream water. This analysis confirmed that stochastic dispersal from the source community was unlikely to shape the observed community composition of the biofilms, in support of species sorting as a major biofilm assembly mechanism. Bulk and active populations generated comparable patterns of community composition in the biofilms and the suspended communities, which suggests similar assembly controls on these populations.},

The basic idea of how to estimate unit requirement of water resources to produce each commodity is introduced and values for major agricultural and stock products are presented. The concept of virtual water and the quantitative estimates can help in assessing a more realistic water scarcity index in each country, projecting future water demand for food supply, increasing public awareness on water, and identifying the processes wasting water in the production. Really required water in exporting countries is generally smaller than virtually required water in importing countries, reflecting the comparative advantage of water use efficiency, and it is estimated to be 680 km3/y for 2000. On the contrary the virtually required water for the same year is estimated to be 1,130 km3/y, and the difference of 450 km3/y is virtually saved by global trade. However, solely virtual water should not be used for any decision making since the idea of virtual water implies only the usage and influence of water and no concerns on social, cultural, and environmental implications. Virtual water trade also does not consider other limiting factors than water.},

Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

Such a transformation now appears to be underway for freshwater resources, driven by increasingly severe water-related crises around the world. These include mismatches between supply and demand; the continued failure to meet basic human needs for water and sanitation; expanding ecological degradation due to extraction of water from natural systems and human-caused climate changes; the development of new technologies for using, treating, monitoring, and reporting on water use; new conceptual work; and growing attention given to water issues by the public and scientific communities. Similar transitions, with additional implications for water, also appear to be underway in the energy and climate fields. For such transitions to be successful, it is important to understand what drives deep changes in the perceptions, management, and use of natural resources; the factors that encourage or discourage changes; and whether strategies can be developed to improve and accelerate those changes that lead to social, economic, and environmental sustainability goals. This paper addresses the concept of resource or environmental transitions in the context of freshwater; reviews theories, data, and frameworks for identifying and analyzing transitions; offers some examples; and identifies key policies to help manage effective and successful transitions.},

These papers have proved controversial, in part because of a lack of direct evidence for a mechanism to explain the phenomenon.

Uptake of nitrogen nutrients increased linearly with species richness in response to changes in flow habitats and disturbance regimes. But when niche structure was experimentally removed, the relationship disappeared. This suggests that habitats with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment than do less-species-rich habitats, allowing the more diverse systems to capture a greater fraction of biologically active resources such as nitrogen.},

	abstract = {Sustainability, equitable allocation and protection of water resources must occur within the framework of integrated management and water governance, but its implementation is problematic. Ongoing global climate change, increasing population, urbanization, and aspirations for better living standards present a challenge to the planetary sustainability. While water use at global scale currently seems to be within its planetary boundary, shortages prevail in several water-scarce and overpopulated regions, and are projected to increase. Furthermore large-scale impoverishment of aquatic biodiversity, ecosystem degradation and reductions in water quality are unaddressed ‘side effects’ in areas where water can be secured for human and economic uses. As the world prepares for Rio+20, challenges to the sustainability of global water security should be scrutinized. Of particular concern is the likelihood that the water-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets may not be achievable due to lack of funding commitments, and a failure of delivery mechanisms including water governance. Constraints on water availability and reductions in water quality jeopardize secure access to this resource for all legitimate stakeholders, including aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Water connects several socio-ecological, economic and geophysical systems at multiple scales and hence constitutes a ‘global water system’. This should be considered both in technical interventions and in governance frameworks. Humans have been changing the global water system in globally significant ways since the industrial revolution, yet without adequate knowledge of the system and its response to change; and without sufficient understanding of how to govern the system at local and global scales. Water security in the 21st century will require better linkage of science and policy, as well as innovative and cross-sectoral initiatives, adaptive management and polycentric governance models that involve all stakeholders. Consensus solutions will need to be achieved by evidence-based mediation, rather than following untested ‘panaceas’, so as to ensure equitable and sustainable global water use.},

	abstract = {Fisheries and aquaculture production, imports, exports and equitability of distribution determine the supply of aquatic food to people. Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand.},

	abstract = {Species conservation, river rehabilitation, stock enhancement, environmental impact assessment and related planning tools require indicators to identify significant impacts but also mitigation success. Since river systems are shaped by disturbances from floods and droughts, typical riverine fish species should have evolved life history traits providing resilience against such disturbances. This study compiled and analyzed resilience traits of European lampreys and fish species to derive a novel sensitivity classification of species to mortality. We assembled life history traits like maximum length, migration type, mortality, fecundity, age at maturity, and generation time of 168 species and created a novel method to weigh and integrate all traits to generate a final sensitivity score from one (low sensitivity) to three (high sensitivity) for each species. Large-bodied, diadromous, rheophilic and lithophilic species such as sturgeons, sea trout, and Atlantic salmon usually appeared to have high sensitivity to additional adult fish mortality, whereas small-bodied, limnophilic and phytophilic species with fast generation cycles were of low sensitivity. The final scoring and classification of 168 European lampreys and fish species according to their sensitivity can be easily regionalized by selecting the most sensitive candidates according to the local species pool. This sensitivity classification has major implications for advancing impact assessment, allowing better targeting of species for conservation measures, benchmarking progress during rehabilitation and enhancing the objective evaluation of the success of restoration projects.},

The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their ‘resilience’) is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales.

Intensive abstraction and regulation cause river ecosystems to shift towards non-natural flow regimes, which might have implications for their water quality, biological structure and functioning. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the potential effects of water stress on nutrients, microcontaminants, biological communities (bacteria, algae, invertebrates and fish), and ecosystem functions (organic matter breakdown, gross primary production and respiration). Despite the different nature of the flow regime changes, our meta-analysis showed significant effects of human-driven water stress, such as significant increases in algal biomass and metabolism and reduced invertebrate richness, abundance and density and organic matter decomposition. Water stress also significantly decreased phosphate concentration and increased the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds. The magnitude of significant effects was dependent on climate, rainfall regime, period of the year, river size and type of water stress. Among the different causes of water stress, flow regulation by dams produced the strongest effects, followed by water abstraction and channelization.},

Combining the Kinoshita curve with the Beck equations to describe the riverbed topography at equilibrium state, a prototype of a synthetic riverbed topography generating model is made for idealized meandering rivers. Such a method can be readily extended and applied to arbitrary meandering rivers in the real world, resulting in the synthetic riverbed topography model, pyRiverBed, presented herein. A meander migration and neck cutoff submodel is also embedded in pyRiverBed. Unlike existing linear and non-linear bend theory-based models, pyRiverbed aims towards generating the riverbed topography for each snapshot during the migration process. The present model can facilitate meandering river researchers to interpolate their field-measured bathymetric data using the synthetic bed, design their non-flat bed laboratory flumes for experiments, and initialize their hydrodynamic and morphodynamic numerical models. It can also provide guidance in stream restoration projects on designing a channel with a morphodynamic equilibrium bed. The quality of generated synthetic bed topography is evaluated through the comparison against both laboratory experiment data and field-measured data. The meander migration submodel is validated using a real-world channel migration and neck cutoff event. The validation results prove that the synthetic riverbed's accuracy is reasonably good, and the meander migration submodel can successfully predict meander migration and neck cutoff.},

	abstract = {Different kinds of observations feature different strengths, e.g. visible-infrared imagery for clouds and radar for precipitation, and, when integrated, better constrain scientific models and hypotheses. Even critical, fundamental operations such as cross-calibrations of related sensors operating on different platforms or orbits, e.g. spacecraft and aircraft, are integrative analyses. The great variety of Earth Science data types and the spatiotemporal irregularity of important low-level (ungridded) data has so far made their integration a customized, tedious process which scales in neither variety nor volume. Generic, higher-level (gridded) data products are easier to use, at the cost of being farther from the original observations and having to settle with grids, interpolation assumptions, and uncertainties that limit their applicability. The root cause of the difficulty in scalably bringing together diverse data is the current rectilinear geo-partitioning of Earth Science data into conventional arrays indexed using consecutive integer indices and then packaged into files. Such indices suffice for archival, search, and retrieval, but lack a common geospatial semantics, which is mitigated by adding on floating-point encoded longitude-latitude information for registration. An alternative to floating-point, the SpatioTemporal Adaptive Resolution Encoding (STARE) provides an integer encoding for geo-spatiotemporal location and neighborhood that transcends the use of files and native array indexing, allowing diverse data to be organized on scalable, distributed computing and storage platforms.},

Several implementation issues are discussed, including the choice of triangulation algorithms and data structures, the effect of several variants of the Delaunay refinement algorithm on mesh quality, and the use of adaptive exact arithmetic to ensure robustness with minimal sacrifice of speed. The problem of triangulating a planar straight line graph (PSLG) without introducing new small angles is shown to be impossible for some PSLGs, contradicting the claim that a variant of the Delaunay refinement algorithm solves this problem.},
