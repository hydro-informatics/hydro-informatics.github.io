## Preface

Large datasets, such as airborne imagery and hydro-meteorological datasets collected worldwide, drive progress in many disciplines. With traditional spreadsheet analysis tools, however, large amounts of data can hardly be analyzed, understood, or used. The courses supported with this website aid hydraulic engineers, geomorphologists, river ecologists, and any water resources-related challenge with tools for efficient data analyses and presentation. The methods described rely on open-access tools to leverage international and interdisciplinary collaboration on all levels.

```{admonition} What does Hydro-informatics stand for?
:class: tip
The term hydroinformatics (or hydro-informatics) is widely used in the field of hydrology. Yet, the syllable *hydro* goes back to the Greek word for *water*. In addition, the term *informatics* can be used as a synonym for studying computational systems. In this light, the term *hydro-informatics* as used on this website also refers to computational studies of river ecosystems. Thus, the primary focus of this ebook is on computer-based applications in the field of hydraulic engineering with its links to ecohydraulics, geomorphology, geo-informatics, and hydrology.

## Contents

Find your course in the {doc}`virtual classroom </lectures/classroom>` ({doc}`lectures and exercises </lectures/lectures>`) and take a seat.

The *Get started* chapter represents a summary of provide systematic workflows to setup your computer for:

- Coding with {doc}`Python </get-started/ide>`;
- Code documentation with {doc}`markdown </documentation/documentation>`;
- Version control with {doc}`git <get-started/git>`;
- Geospatial analyses with {doc}`desktop applications </get-started/geo>` such as *QGIS*;
-  {doc}`Auxiliary tools and open-source/access alternatives </get-started/others>` to proprietary software such as *GNU Octave* (similar to *Matlab*) or *Libre Office* (similar to MS Office).

This ebook provides *Python* tutorials in the form of:

- A general introduction to *Python* programming and object orientation ({doc}`basics </python-basics/python>`);
- An overview of {doc}`geospatial data and analyses with Python </geopy/geo-python>`.

The numerical modelling chapter provides complete workflows for getting started with numerical river models:

- {doc}`ETH Zurich's BASEMENT </numerics/basement>` (v3)
- {doc}`TELEMAC </numerics/telemac>` (currently only Telemac3d)

The theory chapters come along with exercises that align with the learning contents of this ebook and feature applications in water resources management, hydraulic engineering, and ecohydraulics.

The {doc}`Troubleshoot </troubleshoot/dbg-anaconda>` chapter provides solutions and information about how to debug known issues (not that issues ever existed...).




Enjoy a successful and entertaining learning experience!
