## Welcome to Python Programming in Water Resources Engineering and Research

This course introduces the version-control system git and the programming language Python 3. Students learn in this course to use programming methods for engineering tasks, data processing including basic statistical evaluations, and geospatial analyses. Practice-oriented exercises (assignments) guide through the programmatic solution to typical challenges in hydraulic engineering and research such as sediment transport assessments. The communication between efficient algorithms and typical spreadsheet (office) programs is presented and part of the exercises. The course also teaches data import, manipulation (calculation of statistics) and export. The last part of the course introduces geospatial programming methods and data analyses.

Interactive lectures familiarize students with version control via git, markdown language for documentation and Python programming. The course is organized by the [IWS/LWW department](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/lww/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) in the Winter semester. The course uses, however, open access material which is intended to serve as a reference guide and support for independent studies.

## The Classroom

The majority of the course takes place in front of a screen. Students can work on computers at the University of Stuttgart or use their own laptop. The course mainly uses open-access software and the use of commercial codes (as used for example in engineering offices) is explained according to the students' needs and requests.

Previous programming experience is not necessary and the course also and explicitly addresses students who have not yet made use of programming tools.

{% include oa.html content="All fundamental contents and the course content is open access for all to promote the efficient use of data where ever you are and whoever you are." %}

All codes provided in the lectures are based on *Python3* executed within Conda environments. The [install and setup](hypy_install.html#other) section provides more details and installation hints for external packages (preferred open-access).
