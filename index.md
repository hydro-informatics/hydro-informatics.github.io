Big datasets resulting from airborne imagery and worldwide data surveys affect all disciplines. With traditional spreadsheet analysis tools, however, the large amounts of data can hardly be analyzed, understood and used. This website aims to support hydraulic engineers, geomorphologists and river ecologists to use data analysis tools and digital methods for efficient water resources management. All methods described rely on open-access tools to leverage international and interdisciplinary collaboration on all levels.
