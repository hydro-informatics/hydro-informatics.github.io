## Theory
Seasonal storage reservoirs retain water during wet months (e.g., monsoon, or rainy winters in Mediterranean climates) to ensure sufficient drinking water and agricultural supply during dry months. For this purpose, enormous storage volumes are necessary, which often exceed 1,000,000 mÂ³.

The necessary storage volume is determined from historical inflow measurements and target discharge volumes (e.g., agriculture, drinking water, hydropower, or ecological residual water quantities).
The sequent peak algorithm (e.g., [Potter 1977](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1977.tb05564.x) based on [Rippl 1883](https://doi.org/10.1680/imotp.1883.21797) is a decades-old procedure for determining the necessary seasonal storage volume based on a storage volume curve (***SD curve***). The below figure shows an exemplary *SD* curve with volume peaks (local maxima) approximately every 6 months and local volume minima between the peaks. The volume between the last local maximum and the lowest following local minimum determines the required storage volume (see the bright-blue line in the figure).

Scheme of the sequent peak algorithm.
```

The sequent peak algorithm repeats this calculation over multiple years and the highest volume observed determines the required volume.

In this exercise, we use daily flow measurements from Vanilla River (in Vanilla-arid country with monsoon periods) and target outflow volumes to supply farmers and the population of Vanilla-arid country with sufficient water during the dry seasons. This exercise guides you through loading the daily discharge data, creating the monthly *SD* (storage) curve, and calculating the required storage volume.


## Pre-processing of Flow Data

The daily flow data of the Vanilla River are available from 1979 through 2001 in the form of `.csv` files ([`flows` folder](https://github.com/Ecohydraulics/Exercise-SequentPeak/tree/master/flows)).

### Write a Function to Read Flow Data

The function will loop over the *csv* file names and append the file contents to a dictionary of *numpy* arrays. Make sure to `import numpy as np`, `import os`, and `import glob`.

1. Choose a function name (e.g., `def read_data(args):`) and use the following input arguments:
    * `directory`: *string* of path to files
    * `fn_prefix`: *string* of file prefix to strip dict-keys from file name
    * `fn_suffix`: *string* of file suffix to strip dict-keys from file name
    * `ftype`: *string* of file endings
    * `delimiter`: *string* of column separator
1. In the function, test if the provided directory ends on `"/"` or `"\\"` with <br> `directory.endswith("/") or directory.endswith("\\")`<br>and read all files that end with `ftype` (we will use `ftype="csv"` here) with the `glob` library:
    * `if True:` get the the *csv* (`ftype`) file list as <br> `file_list = glob.glob(directory + "*." + ftype.strip(".")`.
    * `if False:` get the the *csv* (`ftype`) file list as <br> `file_list = glob.glob(directory + "/*." + ftype.strip(".")` (the difference is only one powerful `"/"` sign).
1. Create the void dictionary that will contain the file contents as *numpy* arrays: `file_content_dict = {}`
1. Loop over all files in the file list with `for file in file_list:`
    * Generate a key for `file_content_dict`:
        - Detach the file name from the `file` (directory + file name + file ending `ftype`) with `raw_file_name = file.split("/")[-1].split("\\")[-1].split(".csv")[0]`
        - Strip the user-defined `fn_prefix` and `fn_suffix` *strings* from the raw file name and use a `try:` statement to convert the remaining characters to a numeric value: `int(raw_file_name.strip(fn_prefix).strip(fn_suffix)`
        - *Note: We will use later on `fn_prefix="daily_flows_` and `fn_suffix=""` to turn the year contained in the *csv* file names to the key in `file_content_dict`.
        - Use `except ValueError:` in the case that the remaining *string* cannot be converted to `int`: `dict_key = raw_file_name.strip(fn_prefix).strip(fn_suffix)` (if everything is well coded, the script will not need to jump into this exception statement later).
    * Open the `file` (full directory) as a file: `with open(file, mode="r") as f:`
        - Read the file content with `f_content = f.read()`. The *string*  variable `f_content` will look similar to something like `";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.1;0;0\n;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;6.4;0;0\n;0;0;0;0;9.9;0;0;0;0;0.2;0;0\n..."`.
        - *Some explanations: The column data are delimited by a `";"` and every column represents one value per month (i.e., 12 values per row). The rows denote days (i.e., there are 31 rows in each file corresponding to the maximum number of days in one month of a year). In consequence, every row should contain 11 `";"` signs to separate 12 columns and the entire file (`f_content`) should contain 30 `"\n"` signs to separate 31 rows. However, we count 12 `";"` signs per row and 32 to 33 `"\n"` signs in `f_content` because the data logger wrote `";"` at the beginning of each row and added one to two more empty lines to the end of every file. Therefore, we need to `strip()` the bad `";"` and  `"\n"` signs in the following.*
        - To get the number of (valid) rows in every file use `rows = f_content.strip("\n").split("\n").__len__()`
        - To get the number of (valid) columns in every file use `cols = f_content.strip("\n").split("\n")[0].strip(delimiter).split(delimiter).__len__()`
        - Now we can create a void *numpy* array of the size (shape) corresponding to the number of valid rows and columns in every file: `data_array = np.empty((rows, cols), dtype=np.float32)`
        - *Why are we not using directly `np.empty((31, 12)` even though the shape of all files is the same?<br>We want to write a generally valid function and the two lines for deriving the valid number of rows and columns do the generalization job.*
        - Next, we need to parse the values of every line and append them to the until now void `data_array`. Therefore, we split `f_content` into its lines with `split("\n)` and use a *for* loop: `for iteration, line in enumerate(f_content.strip("\n").split("\n"):`. Then,<br> Create an empty list to store line data `line_data = []`. <br>In another *for* loop, strip and split the line by the user-defined `delimiter` (recall: we will use `delimiter=";"`) `for e in line.strip(delimiter).split(delimiter):`. In the *e-for* loop, `try:` to append `e` as a *float* number `line_data.append(np.float(e)` and use `except ValueError:` to `line_data.append(np.nan)` (i.e., append a not-a-number value that we will need because not all months have 31 days).<br>End the *e-for* loop by back-indenting to the `for iteration, line in ...` loop and appending the `line_data` *list* as a *numpy* array to `data_array`: `data_array[iteration] = np.array(line_data)`
        - Back in the `with open(file, ...` statement (use correct indentation level!), update `file_content_dict` with the above-found `dict_key` and the `data_array` of the `file as f`: `file_content_dict.update({dict_key: data_array})`
1. Back at the level of the function (`def read_data(...):` - pay attention to the correct indentation!), `return file_content_dict`

Let us check if the function works as we want it to work by making the script stand-alone through an `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement at the end of the file (recall the [instructions](../python-basics/pypckg.html#standalone)). So the script should look like this:

```python
import glob
import os
import numpy as np


def read_data(directory="", fn_prefix="", fn_suffix="", ftype="csv", delimiter=","):
    # see above


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # LOAD DATA
    file_directory = os.path.abspath("") + "\\flows\\"
    daily_flow_dict = read_data(directory=file_directory, ftype="csv",
                                fn_prefix="daily_flows_", fn_suffix="",
                                delimiter=";")
    print(daily_flow_dict[1995])
```

Running the script returns the `numpy.array` of daily average flows for the year 1995:

### Convert Daily Flows to Monthly Volumes

The sequent peak algorithm takes monthly flow volumes, which corresponds to the sum of daily average discharge multiplied with the duration of one day (e.g, 11.0 mÂ³/s Â· 24 h/d Â· 3600 s/h). Reading the flow data as above shown results in annual flow tables (average daily flows in mÂ³/s) with the `numpy.array`s of the shape 31x12 arrays (matrices) for every year. We want to get the column sums and multiply the sum with 24 h/d Â· 3600 s/h. Because the monthly volumes are in the order of million cubic meters (CMS), dividing the monthly sums by `10**6` will simplify the representation of numbers.

Write a function (e.g., `def daily2monthly(daily_flow_series)`) to perform the conversion of daily average flow series to monthly volumes in 10<sup>6</sup>mÂ³:

1. The function should be called for every dictionary entry (year) of the data series. Therefore, the input argument `daily_flow_series` should be a `numpy.array` with the shape being `(31, 12)`.
1. To get column-wise (monthly) statistics, transpose the input array:<br>`daily_flow_series = np.transpose(daily_flow_series)`
1. Create a void list to store monthly flow values:<br>`monthly_stats = []`
1. Loop over the row of the (transposed) `daily_flow_series` and append the sum multiplied by `24 * 3600 / 10**6` to `monthly_stats`:<br>`for daily_flows_per_month in daily_flow_series:`<br>`    monthly_stats.append(np.nansum(daily_flows_per_month * 24 * 3600) / 10**6)`
1. Return `monthly_stats` as `numpy.array`:<br>`return np.array(monthly_stats)`

Using a for loop, we can now write the monthly volumes similar to the daily flows into a dictionary, which we extend by one year at a time within the `if __name__ == "__main__"` statement:

```python
import ...


def read_data(directory="", fn_prefix="", fn_suffix="", ftype="csv", delimiter=","):
    # see above section


def daily2monthly(daily_flow_series):
    # see above descriptions


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # LOAD DATA
    ...
    # CONVERT DAILY TO MONTHLY DATA
    monthly_vol_dict = {}
    for year, flow_array in daily_flow_dict.items():
        monthly_vol_dict.update({year: daily2monthly(flow_array)})
```

## Sequent Peak Algorithm

With the above routines for reading the flow data, we derived monthly inflow volumes ***In<sub>m</sub>*** in million mÂ³ (stored in `monthly_vol_dict`). For irrigation and drinking water supply, Vanilla-arid country wants to withdraw the following annual volume from the reservoir:

| ***Month***    | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| ***Vol.*** (10<sup>6</sup> mÂ³) | 1.5 | 1.5 | 1.5 | 2   | 4   | 4   | 4   | 5   | 5   | 3   | 2   | 1.5 |

Following the scheme of inflow volumes we can create a `numpy.array` for the monthly outflow volumes ***Out<sub>m</sub>***.<br>
`monthly_supply = np.array([1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.5])`

### Storage Volume and Difference (SD-line) Curves
The storage volume of the present month ***S<sub>m</sub>*** is calculated as the result of the water balance from the last month, for example:<br>
<br>*S<sub>2</sub>* = *S<sub>1</sub>* + *In<sub>1</sub>* - *Out<sub>1</sub>*
<br>*S<sub>3</sub>* = *S<sub>2</sub>* + *In<sub>2</sub>* - *Out<sub>2</sub>* = *S<sub>1</sub>* + *In<sub>1</sub>* + *In<sub>2</sub>* - *Out<sub>1</sub>* - *Out<sub>2</sub>* <br>
In summation notation, we can write:<br>
*S<sub>m+1</sub>* = *S<sub>1</sub>* + *&Sigma;<sub>i=[1:m]</sub>In<sub>i</sub>* - *&Sigma;<sub>i=[1:m]</sub>Out<sub>i</sub>*<br>
The last two terms constitute the storage difference (***SD***) line:<br>
*SD<sub>m</sub>* = *&Sigma;<sub>i=[1:m]</sub>(In<sub>i</sub> - Out<sub>i</sub>)*<br>

Thus, the storage curve as a function of the *SD* line is:<br>
*S<sub>m+1</sub>* = *S<sub>1</sub>* + *SD<sub>m</sub>*

The summation notation of the storage curve as a function of the *SD* line enables us to implement the calculation into a simple `def sequent_peak(in_vol_series, out_vol_target):` function.

```{note}
The following instructions assume that `in_vol_series` corresponds to the above-defined *dictionary* of monthly inflow volumes and `out_vol_target` is the `numpy.array` of monthly outflow target volumes. Alternatively, an approach that uses `in_vol_series` as a sequence of `numpy.array`s can be used.
```

The new `def sequent_peak(in_vol_series, out_vol_target):` function needs to:

* Calculate the monthly storage differences (*In<sub>m</sub>* - *Out<sub>m</sub>*), for example in a *for* loop over the `in_vol_series` dictionary:

```python
    # create storage-difference SD dictionary
    SD_dict = {}
    for year, monthly_volume in in_vol_series.items():
        # add a new dictionary entry for every year
        SD_dict.update({year: []})
        for month_no, in_vol in enumerate(monthly_volume):
            # append one list entry per month (i.e., In_m - Out_m)
            SD_dict[year].append(in_vol - out_vol_target[month_no])
```

* Flatten the dictionary to a list (we could also have done that directly) corresponding to the above-defined *SD* line:

```python
    SD_line = []
    for year in SD_dict.keys():
        for vol in SD_dict[year]:
            SD_line.append(vol)
```

* Calculate the storage line with `storage_line = np.cumsum(SD_line)`
* Find local extrema and there are two (and more) options:
    1. Use `from scipy.signal import argrelextrema` and get the indices (positions of) local extrema and their value from the `storage_line`:<br>
    `seas_max_index = np.array(argrelextrema(storage_line, np.greater, order=12)[0])` <br>
    `seas_min_index = np.array(argrelextrema(storage_line, np.less, order=12)[0])` <br>
    `seas_max_vol = np.take(storage_line, seas_max_index)` <br>
    `seas_min_vol = np.take(storage_line, seas_min_index)` <br>
    1. Write two functions, which consecutively find local maxima and then local minima located between the extrema (HOMEWORK!) OR use `from scipy.signal import find_peaks` to find the indices (positions) - consider to write a `find_seasonal_extrema(storage_line)` function.
* Verify if the curves and extrema are correct by copying the provided `plot_storage_curve` curve to your script ([available in the exercise repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ecohydraulics/Exercise-SequentPeak/master/plot_function.py) and using it as follows:<br>`plot_storage_curve(storage_line, seas_min_index, seas_max_index, seas_min_vol, seas_max_vol)`

```{figure} (https://github.com/Ecohydraulics/media/raw/master/png/storage_curve.png
:alt: sequent peak storage difference sd curve
:name: SDline

Storage Difference (SD) curve.
```

### Calculate Required Storage Volume

The required storage volume corresponds to the largest difference between a local maximum and its consecutive lowest local minimum. Therefore, add the following lines to the `sequent_peak` function:

```python
    required_volume = 0.0
    for i, vol in enumerate(list(seas_max_vol):
        try:
            if (vol - seas_min_vol[i]) > required_volume:
                required_volume = vol - seas_min_vol[i]
        except IndexError:
            print("Reached end of storage line.")
```

Close the `sequent_peak` function with `return required_volume`

### Call Sequent Peak Algorithm
With all required functions written, the last task is to call the functions in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` statement:

```python
import ...


def read_data(directory="", fn_prefix="", fn_suffix="", ftype="csv", delimiter=","):
    # see above section


def daily2monthly(daily_flow_series):
    # see above section


def sequent_peak(in_vol_series, out_vol_target):
    # see above descriptions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # LOAD DATA
    ...
    # CONVERT DAILY TO MONTHLY DATA
    ...
    # MAKE ARRAY OF MONTHLY SUPPLY VOLUMES (IN MILLION CMS)
    monthly_supply = np.array([1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.5])
    # GET REQUIRED STORAGE VOLUME FROM SEQUENT PEAK ALGORITHM
    required_storage = sequent_peak(in_vol_series=monthly_vol_dict, out_vol_target=monthly_supply)
    print("The required storage volume is %0.2f million CMS." % required_storage)

## Closing Remarks

The usage of the sequent peak algorithm (also known as *Rippl's method*, owing to its original author) has evolved and was implemented in sophisticated storage volume control algorithms with predictor models (statistical and/or numerical).

In the end, there are several algorithms and ways to code them. Many factors (e.g. terrain or climate zone) determine whether a seasonal storage is possible or necessary. When determining the storage volume, social and environmental aspects must not be neglected. Every grain of sediment retained is missing in downstream sections of the river, every fish that is no longer able to migrate suffers a loss in habitat, and more than anything else, every inhabitant who suffers economic losses or is even forced to resettle because of the dam must be avoided or adequately compensated.

```{admonition} Homework
Re-write the peak (extrema) analysis either with two consecutive functions, or using [`from scipy.signal import find_peaks`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html).
