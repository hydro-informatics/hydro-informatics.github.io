:class: tip

BASEMENT 4 merges the capacities of v2 and the power and ease of use of v3. It is now available at [https://basement.ethz.ch](https://basement.ethz.ch/), and the tutorials on hydro-informatics.com will soon be updated.
```

This chapter guides through the setup of a two-dimensional (2d) numerical simulation with the freely available software BASEMENT developed at the ETH Zurich (Switzerland). Visit their [website](https://basement.ethz.ch/) to download the program and read the detailed documentation. This tutorial features:

* Setting up a 2d hydrodynamic, steady model
* Running a steady hydrodynamic 2d numerical simulation
* Post-processing of simulation results: Visualize, understand and analyze model outputs.
