# Unsteady 2d Simulation

```{admonition} Requirements
This tutorial is designed for **advanced modelers** and before diving into this tutorial make sure to complete the {ref}`TELEMAC pre-processing <slf-prepro-tm>` and {ref}`Telemac2d steady hydrodynamic modeling <telemac2d-steady>` tutorials.

The case featured in this tutorial was established with the following software:
* {ref}`Notepad++ <npp>` text editor (any other text editor will do just as well.)
* TELEMAC v8p2r0 ({ref}`stand-alone installation <modular-install>`).
* {ref}`QGIS <qgis-install>` and the {ref}`PostTelemac plugin <tm-qgis-plugins>`.
* Debian Linux 10 (Buster) installed on a Virtual Machine (read more in the {ref}`software chapter <chpt-vm-linux>`).
```

## Get Started

This section builds on the SELAFIN (`*.slf`) and Conlim (`*.cli`) boundary condition files that result from the {ref}`TELEMAC pre-processing tutorial <slf-prepro-tm>`. Both files can also be downloaded from the supplemental materials repository of this eBook:

* [Download qgismesh.slf](https://github.com/hydro-informatics/telemac/raw/main/bk-slf/qgismesh.slf).
* [Download boundaries.cli](https://github.com/hydro-informatics/telemac/raw/main/bk-slf/boundaries.cli).

Consider saving both files in a new folder, such as `/steady2d-tutorial/` that will contain all model files.

### Define unsteady flow boundaries

In addition, users can define a liquid boundary conditions file (*qsl*) to define time-dependent boundary conditions (e.g., discharge, water depth, flow velocity or tracers).
The name format of the boundary conditions file can be modified in the steering file with:

```
/steering.cas
BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FILE : 'bc_channel.cli'
LIQUID BOUNDARIES FILE   : 'bc_unsteady.qsl'
```

Example for a liquid boundary conditions file:
```
# bc_unsteady.qsl
# Time-dependent inflow (discharge Q(2) and outflow (depth SL(1)
T           Q(1)     SL(2)
s           m3/s     m
0.            0.     5.0
500.        100.     5.0
5000.       150.     5.0
```

### Stage-discharge (or WSE-Q) Relationship

Define a stage-discharge file (*ASCII* format) to use a stage (water surface elevation *WSE*) - discharge relationship for boundary conditions. Such files typically apply to the downstream boundary of a model at control sections (e.g., a free overflow weir). To use a stage-discharge file, define the following keyword in the steering file:

```
/steering.cas
STAGE-DISCHARGE CURVES FILE : YES
```
