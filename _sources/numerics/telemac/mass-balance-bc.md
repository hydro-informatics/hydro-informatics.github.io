# Boundaries & Mass Convergence

The conservation of mass and definition of boundary conditions go hand in hand, as overdetermined or wrongly constrained liquid boundaries entail unbalanced water or sediment masses, or other computational issues, such as supercritical flows (resulting from high {term}`Froude numbers <Froude number>`). This chapter looks under the hood of boundary conditions, how they affect mass balance, flux convergence analysis, and what can be done to obtain a robust, mass-conservative numerical Telemac model. A **complete workflow for robust modeling is provided at the {ref}`end of this chapter <tm-foc-mass-workflow>`**.
