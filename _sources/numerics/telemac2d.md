```{admonition} Growing chapter
This chapter is currently still growing and contents are in a beta-state.
```

Telemac2d iteratively solves the depth-averaged {term}`Navier-Stokes equations` (i.e., the {term}`Shallow water equations`). 


The Telemac2d tutorials build on the SELAFIN (`*.slf`) and Conlim (`*.cli`) boundary condition files that result from the {ref}`TELEMAC pre-processing tutorial <slf-prepro-tm>`.

The {ref}`Steady Simulation <telemac2d-steady>` tutorial features using the `*.slf` and `*.cli` files for a steady hydrodynamic 2d simulation with the Telemac2d module.

  The tutorial descriptions refer to the {{ tm2d }}.
