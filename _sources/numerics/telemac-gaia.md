This chapter guides through modelling {term}`Sediment transport` and related phenomena in rivers (morphodynamics) with Telemac2d and the Gaia module. Notably, a simple steady2d example demonstrates how {term}`Sediment transport` in the form of bedload can be modeled with the TELEMAC software suite.

## Under construction. Expected release in the next months.

Thank you for your patience.
