This chapter guides through modeling {term}`Sediment transport` and related phenomena in rivers (morphodynamics) with Telemac2d and the Gaia module. Notably, a simple steady2d example demonstrates how {term}`Sediment transport` in the form of {term}`Bedload` and {term}`Suspended load` can be modeled with the TELEMAC software suite.
