# Pre-processing with QGIS

```{admonition} Requirements
:class: attention
This tutorial is designed for **beginners** and before diving into this tutorial make sure to:

* Follow the installation instructions for {ref}`qgis-install` in this eBook.
* Read (or watch) and understand this eBook's {ref}`qgis-tutorial`.
```

The first steps in numerical modeling of a river with BASEMENT consist in the conversion of a **Digital Elevation Model ({term}`DEM`)** into a computational mesh. This tutorial guides through the creation of a QGIS project for converting a {term}`DEM` ({term}`GeoTIFF`) into a computational mesh that can be used with various numerical modeling software featured in this eBook. At the end of this tutorial, {ref}`chpt-basement` users will have generated a computational grid in the {term}`SMS 2dm` format.

```{admonition} Platform compatibility
:class: tip
All software applications featured in this tutorial can be run on *Linux*, *Windows*, and *macOS* (in theory - not tested) platforms. Note that {ref}`chpt-basement` itself will not work on *macOS* platforms.
```

(start-qgis)=
## QGIS Setup

### Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

Launch QGIS and {ref}`create a new QGIS project <qgis-project>` to get started with this tutorial.
As featured in the {ref}`qgis-tutorial`, set up a coordinate reference system (CRS) for the project. This example uses data of a river in Bavaria (Germany zone 4), which requires the following CRS:

* In the QGIS top menu go to **Project** > **Properties**.
* Activate the **CRS** tab.
* Enter `Germany_Zone_4` and select the CRS shown in {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-crs>`.
* Click **Apply** and **OK**.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/inn-crs.png
:alt: qgis set coordinate reference system crs germany zone_4 Inn river
:name: qgis-crs

Define Germany_Zone_4 as project CRS.
```

```{admonition} Save the project...
:class: tip
Save the QGIS project (**Project** > **Save As...**), for example, under the name **prepro-tutorial.qgz**.
```

(get-basemesh)=
### Get the BASEmesh Plugin

Install *BASEMENT*'s *BASEmesh* Plugin (instructions from the *BASEMENT* System Manual):

* Load the *QGIS* plugin manager: **Plugins** menu > **Manage and Install Plugins**.
* Go to the **Settings** tab.
* Scroll to the bottom (**Plugin Repositories** listbox in {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-plugins>`), click on **Add...**.
* In the popup window enter:
  * a name for the new repository, for instance, `BASEmesh Plugin Repository`
  * the repository address: [https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~basement/qgis_plugins/qgis_plugins.xml](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~basement/qgis_plugins/qgis_plugins.xml)
  * keep all other defaults.
* Click **OK**. The new repository should now be visible in the **Plugin Repositories** listbox. If the connection is **OK**.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/bm-plugin.png
:alt: qgis basement plugins
:name: qgis-plugins

Add the BASEMENT repository to QGIS' Plugins Manager.
```

* Still in the **Plugins** popup window go back to the **All** tab an enter `basemesh` in the search field.
* Find the **newest BASEmesh** (i.e., **Available version** >= 2.0.0) plugin and click on **Install Plugin**.
* After the successful installation **Close** the **Plugins** popup window.
* Verify that the *BASEmesh 2* plugin is now available in the QGIS' **Plugins** menu (see {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-pluggedin>`).

```{figure} ../img/qgis/bm-pluggedin.png
:alt: qgis basement plugins
:name: qgis-pluggedin

The BASEmesh 2 plugin is available in QGIS' Plugins menu after the successful installation.
```


(get-dem)=
## Load DEM

This tutorial uses an application-ready {term}`DEM` in {term}`GeoTIFF` {ref}`raster` format that stems from a {term}`Lidar` point cloud. The {term}`DEM` raster provides height (Z) information from a section of a gravel-cobble bed river in South-East Germany, which constitutes the baseline for the computational grids featured in the next sections. To get the provided DEM in the *QGIS* project:

* [**Download the example DEM GeoTIFF**](https://github.com/hydro-informatics/materials-bm/raw/main/rasters/dem.tif) and save it in the same folder (`/Project Home/` or a sub-directory) as the above-create **qgz** project.
* Add the downloaded DEM as a new raster layer in *QGIS*:
  * In *QGIS*' **Browser** panel find the **Project Home** directory where you downloaded the DEM *tif*.
  * Drag the DEM *tif* from the **Project Home** folder into QGIS' **Layer** panel.
* To facilitate delineating specific regions of the river ecosystem later, add a {ref}`satellite imagery basemap <basemap>` (XYZ tile) under the {term}`DEM` and customize the layer symbology.

```{admonition} What are QGIS panels again?
:class: tip
Learn more in the *QGIS* tutorial on {ref}`qgis-tbx-install`.
```

The DEM should now be displayed on the map (if not: right-click on the DEM layer and click on **Zoom to Layer(s)** in the context menu) as shown in {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-dem-basemap>`.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/dem-basemap.png
:alt: qgis import raster DEM basemap
:name: qgis-dem-basemap

The imported DEM on a Google Satellite imagery basemap (source: Google / GeoBasis-DEBKG 2019). The flow direction is from left to right following the **Q** arrow.
```


(make-2dm)=
## Create 2dm Mesh

The generation of a {term}`SMS 2dm` uses the {ref}`QGIS BASEmesh plugin <get-basemesh>` and requires drawing a

* {ref}`Line Shapefile <create-line-shp>` containing model boundaries and internal breaklines between model regions with different characteristics (section on {ref}`boundary`);
* {ref}`Line Shapefile <create-line-shp>` containing model boundaries for assigning inflow and outflow conditions (section on {ref}`liquid-boundary`); and a
* {ref}`Point Shapefile <create-point-shp>` containing markers for the definition of characteristics of model regions (section on {ref}`regions`).

These shapefiles enable to generate a {ref}`Quality Mesh <qualm>`. Ultimately, height information is {ref}`interpolated to the quality mesh <qualm-interp>` and the resulting mesh is saved as {term}`SMS 2dm` file. The next sections walk through the procedure step by step with detailed explanations. Additional materials and intermediate data products are provided in the supplemental data repository ([materials-bm](https://github.com/hydro-informatics/materials-bm)) for this tutorial.


(boundary)=
### Model Boundary and Breaklines

The model boundary defines the model extent and can be divided into regions with different characteristics (e.g., roughness values) through breaklines. Breaklines indicate, for instance, channel banks and the riverbed (main channel), and need to be inside the DEM extents. Boundary lines and breaklines are stored in a {ref}`Line Shapefile <create-line-shp>` that BASEmesh uses to find both model boundaries and internal breaklines between model regions. For this purpose, {ref}`create-line-shp` with **one Text Field** called **LineType** and call it **breaklines.shp** (**Layer** > **Create Layer** > **New Shapefile Layer**). Click on QGIS' **Layers** menu > **Create Layer** > **New Shapefile Layer...** (see {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-new-lyr>`). Make sure to select `ESRI: 31494 - Germany_Zone_4` as {term}`CRS` <img src="../img/qgis/sym-crs.png">.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/create-shp-layer.png
:alt: qgis new layer basemesh
:name: qgis-new-lyr

Create a new shapefile from QGIS' Layers menu.
```

It is important that the lines do not overlap to avoid ambiguous or missing definitions of regions and to ensure that all boundary lines form closed regions (areas). Therefore, activate snapping:

* Activate the *Snapping Toolbar*: **View** > **Toolbars** > **Snapping Toolbar**
* In the **Snapping toolbar** > **Enable Snapping** <img src="../img/qgis/snapping-horseshoe.png">
* Enable snapping for
  * **Vertex**, **Segment**, and **Middle of Segments** <img src="../img/qgis/snapping-vertex-segments.png">.
  * **Snapping on Intersections** <img src="../img/qgis/snapping-intersection.png">.

Next, start to edit **breaklines.shp** by clicking on the yellow pen <img src="../img/qgis/yellow-pen.png"> and draw the lines indicated in {numref}`Fig. %s <breaklines>` by activating **Add Line Feature** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-add-line.png">.

* **Boundaries of the** model at the left and the right **floodplain limits**:
  * Delineate the outer bounds of the floodplains.
  * Make sure that all points and lines are inside the {ref}`DEM layer <get-dem>`.
  * Do not cross the river (wetted area indicated by the satellite imagery basemap).
  * **Finalize** every line with a **right-click**.
  * For the **LineType** field use text values such as **boundary left/right floodplain**.
  * Refer to the **red lines in {numref}`Fig. %s <breaklines>`**.
* **Breaklines of the left bank (LB) and right bank (RB)**:
  * Draw lines along the wetted main channel indicated in the satellite imagery basemap.
  * Make sure that line ends perfectly coincide with the before-created floodplain boundary lines (this is where snapping helps); thus, the main channel's hard breaklines and the floodplain boundary lines need to enclose the floodplains without any gap between the lines.
  * For the **LineType** field use text values such as **hardline LB/RB**.
  * Refer to the **yellow-orange lines in {numref}`Fig. %s <breaklines>`** (note the delineation of the small tributaries in the top left at the left bank and in the bottom right at the right bank).
* **Breaklines of gravel banks**:
  * Draw lines along the gravel banks that are visible in the satellite imagery basemap in the main channel.
  * Make sure that the line ends perfectly coincide with the before-created main channel breaklines (hardlines); thus, the main channel's hard breaklines and the gravel bank breaklines need to enclose the gravel banks without any gap between the lines.
  * For the **LineType** field use text values such as **hardline gravel bank**.
  * Refer to the **green-ish lines in {numref}`Fig. %s <breaklines>`**.
* Optional: **Breaklines of block ramps**:
  * Find the rough block ramps (effervescing waters) in the satellite imagery basemap and delineate them by drawing lines across the wetted main channel.
  * Make sure that the line ends perfectly coincide with the main channel breaklines; thus, the main channel's hard breaklines and the block ramp breaklines need to enclose the block ramps without any gap between the lines.
  * For the **LineType** field use text values such as **hardline sss** (or anything else - the example refers to the German word <u>S</u>chütt<u>s</u>tein<u>s</u>chwelle).
  * Refer to the **blue lines in {numref}`Fig. %s <breaklines>`**.
* Optional: **Breakline of a sandbank**:
  * Find the sandbank deposit in the upper left corner in {numref}`Fig. %s <breaklines>` on the satellite imagery basemap and delineate it by drawing a smoothly curved line.
  * Make sure that the line ends perfectly coincide with the main channel breaklines and embrace a closed area without any gap between the lines.
  * For the **LineType** field use text values such as **hardline sand**.
  * Refer to the **purple line** in the upper left corner **in {numref}`Fig. %s <breaklines>`**.

To **correct drawing errors** use the **Vertex Tool** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-vertex-tool.png">. Finally, save the new lines (edits of **breaklines.shp**) by clicking on the **Save Layer Edits** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-save-edits.png"> symbol. **Stop (Toggle) Editing** by clicking again on the yellow pen <img src="../img/qgis/yellow-pen.png"> symbol.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/breaklines.png
:alt: qgis basement basemesh draw breaklines boundaries
:name: breaklines

Boundary and breaklines to draw in **breaklines.shp**. Left and right banks and floodplains are orientated in the flow direction (**Q** arrow).
```

```{admonition} Troubles with drawing boundaries and breaklines?
:class: tip
Download the [zipped breaklines shapefile](https://github.com/hydro-informatics/materials-bm/raw/main/shapefiles/breaklines.zip) shown in the above figure and unpack it into the project folder, for instance, `/Project Home/shapefiles/breaklines.[SHP]`.
```

The default layer style is **Single Symbol**. For better representation, double-click on the breaklines layer, go to the **Symbology** tab and select **Categorized** (or **Graduated**) instead of **Single Symbol** (at the very top of the **Layer Properties** window). In the **Value** field, select **LineType**, then click the **classify** button on the bottom of the **Layer Properties** window. The listbox will now show the *LineType* values.

```{admonition} Draw boundaries of complex DEMs...
:class: tip
Drawing boundaries manually around large {term}`DEM`s can be very time consuming, in particular, if the raw data are a point cloud and not yet converted to a {ref}`raster`.

If you are dealing with a point cloud, consider using *QGIS* [Convex Hull tool](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/vector_analysis/spatial_statistics.html?highlight=convex%20hull#basic-fa-create-a-test-dataset) that draws a tight bounding polygon around points.

If you are dealing with a large {term}`GeoTIFF`, consider using QGIS' [Raster to Vector](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/complete_analysis/raster_to_vector.html) tool.
```


(liquid-boundary)=
### Liquid (Hydraulic) Boundaries

The liquid boundaries define where hydraulic conditions, such as a given discharge or stage-discharge relationship, apply at the model inflow (upstream) and outflow (downstream) limits. Thus, a functional river model requires at least one inflow boundary (line) where mass flow into the model and one outflow boundary (line) where mass fluxes leave the model. For this purpose, {ref}`create-line-shp` called **liquid-boundaries.shp** and define **two text data fields** named **type** and **stringdef**. Make sure that **snapping** is still **enabled** (as above explained in the {ref}`boundary` section) and **Toggle (Start) Editing** <img src="../img/qgis/yellow-pen.png"> the new **liquid-boundaries.shp**. Then draw two lines:

* Activate **Add Line Feature** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-add-line.png">.
* Draw an inflow boundary line (see also {numref}`Fig. %s <inflow-boundary>`):
  * Zoom to the inflow region of the DEM limits, where there is a **gap between** the above-created **floodplain boundary breaklines**.
  * Start drawing a line on the left bank (left side of the below figure) and moved Eastwards (i.e., to the right) to make seven more points across the river.
  * The **seventh point** needs to **coincide** with the end of the right bank's **floodplain boundary breakline**.
  * Thus, the upstream flow is coming from the right-hand side of the inflow boundary line (i.e., the upstream flow direction will be `right` for the numerical model).
  * **Finalize** the line with a **right-click**, and enter `Inflow` in the **type** field and `inflow` in the **stringdef** field (the case matters).
  * To **correct drawing errors** use the **Vertex Tool** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-vertex-tool.png">.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/inflow-boundary.png
:alt: qgis basemesh draw inflow boundary line
:name: inflow-boundary

The inflow boundary line is drawn from the left to the right (i.e., the upstream flow is coming from the right-hand side of the inflow boundary line). The sequence of buttons to use is highlighted by the red boxes.
```

* Next, draw an outflow boundary line (see also {numref}`Fig. %s <outflow-boundary>`):
  * Zoom to the outflow region of the DEM limits, where there is a **gap between** the above-created **floodplain boundary breaklines**.
  * Start drawing a line on the left bank (top of the below figure) and move Southwestwards (i.e., to the bottom) to make seven more points across the river.
  * The **seventh point** needs to **coincide** with the end of the right bank's **floodplain boundary breakline**.
  * Thus, the upstream flow is coming from the right-hand side of the outflow boundary line (i.e., the upstream flow direction will be `right` for the numerical model).
  * **Finalize** the line with a **right-click**, and enter `Outflow` in the **type** field and `outflow` in the **stringdef** field (the case matters).
  * To **correct drawing errors** use the **Vertex Tool** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-vertex-tool.png">.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/outflow-boundary.png
:alt: qgis basemesh draw outflow boundary line
:name: outflow-boundary

The outflow boundary line is drawn from the top to the bottom (i.e., the upstream flow is coming from the right hand-side of the outflow boundary line).
```

```{admonition} Constraints of inflow and outflow boundaries
:class: important
The inflow and outflow boundary lines must have the same number of nodes (here 7 plus 1) and no liquid boundary line may have more than 40 nodes.
```

Finally, save the liquid boundary lines (edits of **liquid-boundaries.shp**) by clicking on the **Save Layer Edits** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-save-edits.png"> symbol. **Stop (Toggle) Editing** by clicking again on the yellow pen <img src="../img/qgis/yellow-pen.png"> symbol.

```{admonition} Troubles with drawing the liquid boundary lines?
:class: tip

```

```{admonition} stringdefs
:class: note
The *stringdefs* field values can be directly used with {ref}`chpt-basement`, where hydraulic data (e.g., discharge, water depth, or stage-discharge relations) can be assigned to the here defined georeferenced inflow and outflow boundary lines.
```

(regions)=
### Region Markers

Region markers are placed inside regions defined by boundary lines and breaklines. Every region marker (i.e., a point somewhere in the region area) assigns, for instance, a material identifier (MATIDs) and a maximum mesh cell area. The latter option enables to define small mesh cells (mesh areas) in the active channel bed and can larger cell areas in the floodplain regions. {ref}`create-point-shp` named **raster-points.shp** with the following definitions (see also {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-reg-lyr>`):

* Define the **File name** as **region-points.shp** (or similar)
* Ensure the **Geometry type** is **Point**
* The {term}`CRS` <img src="../img/qgis/sym-crs.png"> corresponds to Germany Zone 4 ({ref}`see project CRS <start-qgis>`)
* Add three **New Field**s (in addition to the default **Integer** type **ID** field):
  * **max_area** = **Decimal number** (**length** = 10, **precision** = 3)
  * **MATID** = **Whole number** (**length** = 3)
  * **type** = **Text data** (**length** = 20)
* Click **OK** to create the new point shapefile.

```{figure} ../img/qgis/bm-region-pts-create.png
:alt: basement mesh qgis region layer points
:name: qgis-reg-lyr

Definitions and fields to be added to the region-points shapefile.
```

Consider to **deactivate snapping** for drawing the region markers to avoid that region markers coincide with any line. Then, **Toggle (Start) Editing** <img src="../img/qgis/yellow-pen.png"> the new **region-points.shp** file and activate **Add Point Feature** <img src="../img/qgis/sym-add-point.png">. Draw one point in every area section that is enclosed by breaklines and (liquid) boundary lines. Depending on the apparent area type from the satellite imagery basemap, assign one of the five regions listed in {numref}`Tab. %s <region-defs>` to every point.

```{list-table} Region names and their **max_area**, **MATID**, and **type** field values.

```

(qualm)=
### Create a Quality Mesh

*BASEmesh*'s quality mesh tool creates a computationally efficient triangular mesh based on {cite:t}`shewchuk1996` and within the above-defined model boundaries. The tool associates mesh properties with the regions shapefile ([see above section on {ref}`regions`), but it does not include elevation data. Thus, after generating a quality mesh, elevation information needs to be added. This section explains the quality mesh generation and the next section features the interpolation of bottom elevations.

In QGIS' **Plugins** menu, click on **BASEmesh 2** > **QUALITY MESHING** to open the quality mesh tool. Make the following settings in the popup window (see also {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-qualm>`):

* Triangulation constraints frame:
  * **Breaklines** = **breaklines** (see {ref}`boundary`).
  * Keep all other defaults.
* Regions frame:
  * **Activate the Regions** checkbox.
  * **Region marker layer** = **regions-points** (see {ref}`regions`).
  * **Activate the MATID field** checkbox and select the *regions-points* shapefile's **MATID field**.
  * **Activate the Maximum area field** checkbox and select the *regions-points* shapefile's **max_area field**.
* Mesh domain frame: keep defaults.
* String definitions frame:
  * **Activate the String definitions** checkbox.
  * **String definitions layer** = **liquid boundaries**.
  * **String definitions ID field** =  **stringdef**.
  * **Activate the Include in 2DM node strings (BASEMENT 3)** checkbox.
  * Ignore all BASEMENT 2.8 options.
* Settings frame: keep defaults.
* Output frame:
  * Click on the **Browse...** button and define a **2dm** file name in the `/Project Home/` directory, such as **prepro-tutorial_quality-mesh.2dm**.
* Click on the **Run** button to create the quality mesh.


```{figure} ../img/qgis/bm-quality-meshing-success.png
:alt: basement qgis quality mesh tin
:name: qgis-qualm

Definitions to be made in BASEmesh's Quality meshing tool.
```

Quality meshing may take time. After a successful mesh generation the file **prepro-tutorial_quality-mesh-interp.2dm** will have been generated.

(qualm-interp)=
### Interpolate Bottom Elevation to Quality Mesh

The *BASEmesh* plugin's **Interpolation** tool projects bottom elevation data onto the quality mesh by interpolation from another mesh or a {term}`DEM` {ref}`raster`. Here, we use the {ref}`above-introduced DEM GeoTIFF <get-dem>`. To run the interpolation, open *BASEmesh*'s **Interpolation** tool (*QGIS* **Plugins** menu > **BASEmesh 2** > **Interpolation**) and make the following settings (see also {numref}`Fig. %s <qgis-qualm-interp>`):

* In the **Mesh layer to interpolate** frame, select **prepro-tutorial_quality-mesh**.
* In the **Basic** tab find the **Elevation source** frame and activate the **Activation via DEM (Raster)** radio button.
* Select **dem.tif** GeoTIFF (see {ref}`get-dem` section) as **Raster layer**.
* In the **Output** frame click on the **Browse** button to define an output mesh name in the `/Project Home/` directory, for example, **prepro-tutorial_quality-mesh-interp.2dm**
* Click **Run** to create the height-interpolated mesh.

```{admonition} Error with BASEmesh v2.0.9 - Interpolation via DEM not working
:class: error

Since BASEmesh v2.0.9, the **Interpolation** window does not detect any **Raster layer** (nothing can be selected from the dropdown menu). A functional work-around is to convert the DEM raster into a mesh file:

1. Convert the DEM into a point shapefile (**raster to vector**) and make sure the point's attribute table is filled with elevations.
2. Use the **TIN Mesh Creation** tool to generate a TIN elevation mesh with elevation data.
3. In BASEmesh's **Interpolation** tool, select the option **Interpolation via elevation Mesh** and select the TIN elevation mesh created before.
4. Click **Run** to continue with the tutorial.

To find the above-mentioned conversion tools, go to QGIS **Processing** top menu > **Toolbox** and enter the tool names in the *search...* field.

```

```

After the elevation interpolation, verify that the elevations are correctly assigned (i.e., the **Bed Elevation** should have taken values between **367** and **387** m a.s.l.). To modify the layer visualization (symbology) double-click on the new **prepro-tutorial_quality-mesh-interp** and go to the **Symbology** ribbon. Select **Graduated** at the very top of the window, set the **Value** to Z, **Method** to COLOR, choose a color ramp, and click on the **classify** bottom (lower part of the window). Click on **Apply** and **OK** to close the symbology settings. {numref}`Figure %s <qgis-verify-qualm>` shows an example visualization of the height-interpolated mesh.

## Usage with BASEMENT

The 2dm mesh file produced in this tutorial can be directly used with {ref}`chpt-basement`, where only the definition of properties of the geometric (e.g., roughness coefficients) and liquid (e.g., discharges) are required as explained later.
