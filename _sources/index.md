## Preface

Large datasets, such as airborne imagery and hydro-meteorological datasets collected worldwide, drive progress in many disciplines. With traditional spreadsheet analysis tools, however, large amounts of data can hardly be analyzed, understood, or used. The courses supported with this website aid hydraulic engineers, geomorphologists, river ecologists, and any water resources-related challenge with tools for efficient data analyses and presentation. The methods described rely on open-access tools to leverage international and interdisciplinary collaboration on all levels.

```{admonition} What is hydro-informatics.com?
:class: tip
The term hydroinformatics (or hydro-informatics) refers to a sub-discipline of informatics and has its origins in computational hydraulics. Hydroinformatics involves numerical modeling as well as data science methods for the efficient and sustainable use of water resources (definition derived from the {term}`IAHR`'s and IWA [Joint Committee on Hydroinformatics](https://www.iahr.org/index/committe/15)).
The syllable *hydro* goes back to the Greek word for *water* and the term *informatics* can be used as a synonym for studying computational systems. To this end, the *hydro-informatics.com* eBook features the use of *hydroinformatics* to leverage studies of river ecosystems with regards to hydraulic engineering, ecohydraulics, geomorphology, geo-informatics, and hydrology.

## Contents

This eBook features a {doc}`virtual classroom </lectures/classroom>` with open source/access materials for {doc}`lectures and exercises </lectures/lectures>`. Students at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) can learn more about registering for courses in the {ref}`chpt-take-seat` chapter.

The eBook provides tutorials for:

* Coding with {ref}`Python <install-python>` including
  * Guidance to {ref}`install-python`
  * A general introduction to {doc}`Python programming and object orientation </python-basics/python>`)
  * Geospatial data analyses with {doc}`Python </geopy/geo-python>`
* Code and project {doc}`documentation </documentation/documentation>` (e.g., with *Markdown* or *reStructuredText*)
* Version control with {doc}`git </get-started/git>`
* Geospatial analyses with {ref}`QGIS <qgis-tutorial>`
* Numerical modeling with
  * The {doc}`ETH Zurich's BASEMENT </numerics/basement>` (v3) software (2d hydrodynamics)
  * {doc}`TELEMAC </numerics/telemac>` (2d, 3d, and morphodynamics)

All applications use open source or open access software, and the {ref}`software` chapter provides guidance on finding and installing appropriate and efficient software.

The theory chapters come along with exercises that align with the learning contents of this eBook and feature applications in water resources management, hydraulic engineering, and ecohydraulics.

The {doc}`Troubleshoot </troubleshoot/dbg-anaconda>` chapter provides solutions and information about how to debug known issues (not that issues ever existed...).


Enjoy a successful and entertaining learning experience!
