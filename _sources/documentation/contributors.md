:::{grid-item-card} Sebastian Schwindt
:columns: 8

Sebastian leads the hydro-morphological modeling group at the [University of Stuttgart's IWS](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/). His background and core expertise are data acquisitions in combination with deterministic-statistic computational methods to derive data-driven insights from hydraulic research. Sebastian did his PhD at the Swiss [Ecole Polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/), and a postdoc with the [Pasternack group](https://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).
