## About Python

[*Python*](https://www.python.org) is a flexible and popular programming language that is easy to learn and can be used on almost all [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) such as [*Linux*](https://www.linux.org/), *Windows*, or *macOS*. A large and strong developer community provides many libraries for free, which can be installed and used as packages in *Python*. Besides engineering and scientific data analysis, *Python* also supports the development of web applications and services, desktop applications (graphical user interfaces - GUIs), scripting and [*Jupyter notebooks*](https://jupyter.org/). *Python* is used by many scientific institutions and software developers, but also more and more in other industries. This *Python* course is tailored for engineers and scientists in the field of hydraulics and eco-morphodynamics.

The content on the following pages is based on [*Jupyter notebooks*](https://jupyter.org/) and inspired by tutorials provided on [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). The descriptions aim to provide solid knowledge for the efficient use of *Python*. Keep in mind that there are always several possibilities to write code with some sophisticated gimmicks, which cannot all be covered within one course.

```{tip}
The *Jupyter notebooks* are provided along with active courses via the University of Stuttgart's [ILIAS portal](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_crs_2101155.html) and upon e-mail request ([contact via the IWS/LWW web site](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Schwindt/)).
